12:11:50 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : What does power mean to you?
12:25:54 From Susanne Mueller (she/her) to Everyone : That really resonates @charlie jones
12:29:02 From jo to Everyone : Please could you post the link to the jam board again here? Thank you.
12:29:10 From Lily Spek to Everyone : https://jamboard.google.com/d/1G8yz-Qt--iFyfmUfJfigZ9vPumpaWDMVOX77qmzh154/viewer?f=0
12:29:18 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Thanks Lily!
12:29:39 From St√©phanie Krus to Everyone : this is the cards: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11Xl1tOMfxUr4PdotyTjNUvvIpN4U_57T6hpKR43c27k/edit?usp=sharing
12:30:07 From Wu Yue to Everyone : the link need access
12:30:13 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Welcome to those who just joined. We‚Äôve given some background, worked to explore what power means (see JamBoard) and Nour is now explaining rules of the game (which become much simpler as we‚Äôre playing!)
12:30:32 From St√©phanie Krus to Everyone : sorry here is the right one!: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/197xH4vsxEKFMfzTmr45AzmGBhyNxeCJr_VWCNoWu7BE/edit#slide=id.g8d75ee2853_0_228
12:30:55 From Wu Yue to Everyone : works now! cheers
12:31:03 From Thea Snow to Everyone : For those who haven‚Äôt printed/drawn the cards, please do so now!
12:31:14 From Ottawa Therapy Dogs to St√©phanie Krus(Direct Message) : This is awesome, great event
12:31:29 From Thea Snow to Everyone : With thanks to Stephanie, here are the cards
12:31:31 From √Ösa Holmberg to Everyone : How do you mean print drawn?
12:31:33 From Thea Snow to Everyone : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/197xH4vsxEKFMfzTmr45AzmGBhyNxeCJr_VWCNoWu7BE/edit#slide=id.g8d75ee2853_0_228
12:31:53 From Thea Snow to Everyone : You can print them (on a printer) or just draw them on a piece of paper
12:32:32 From Thea Snow to Everyone : You should rip up the piece of paper into pieces so that you have ten cards to use
12:32:52 From √Ösa Holmberg to Everyone : Ah.
12:33:09 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : nice one, I like the idea of a wild card :)
12:33:40 From Faye Anderson to Everyone : Yes, lovely to bring that in...
12:33:55 From Rachel Bucknall to Everyone : Could you please explain the wildcard again?
12:33:57 From Sam Villis to Everyone : I missed the one before wellness
12:33:58 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : frantically drawing :)
12:34:08 From Thea Snow to Everyone : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/197xH4vsxEKFMfzTmr45AzmGBhyNxeCJr_VWCNoWu7BE/edit#slide=id.g8d75ee2853_0_228
12:34:11 From Cate McLaurin to Everyone : love the idea of a wildcard - which will elect our own perceptions of power that we have/bring
12:34:13 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Sam - they‚Äôre all there
12:34:15 From Cate McLaurin to Everyone : elicit
12:35:37 From Sam Villis to Everyone : Thanks!
12:35:38 From Ottawa Therapy Dogs to St√©phanie Krus(Direct Message) : I missed the first one, could you pls repeat it again?
12:35:56 From Ottawa Therapy Dogs to Everyone : I missed the first one, could you pls repeat it again?
12:36:11 From Thea Snow to Everyone : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/197xH4vsxEKFMfzTmr45AzmGBhyNxeCJr_VWCNoWu7BE/edit#slide=id.g8d75ee2853_0_228
12:36:23 From Thea Snow to Everyone : You can see all of them in the link above :)
12:36:39 From Vinishree Solanki to Everyone : Can you explain the second one
12:36:56 From Thea Snow to Everyone : The second one is tricky!
12:36:58 From Vanessa Rodrigues to Everyone : Could you please repeat what perceived or explicit permission was?
12:37:16 From Thea Snow to Everyone : That‚Äôs the second one Vanessa! We don‚Äôt really know!
12:37:16 From Esther_meng to Everyone : how many cards can we get?
12:37:39 From Thea Snow to Everyone : You get all ten cards Esther
12:37:46 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Plus one wild card
12:38:24 From Abe Greenspoon to Everyone : I just scribbled the words. No pictures. Low fi
12:38:32 From Hannah Dickson to Everyone : Snap Abe!
12:38:40 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Oh no you two
12:38:48 From Abe Greenspoon to Everyone : Did it. Done
12:38:58 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : ha! me too Abe :)
12:39:52 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Here are the cards again one more time https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/197xH4vsxEKFMfzTmr45AzmGBhyNxeCJr_VWCNoWu7BE/edit#slide=id.g8d75ee2853_0_228
12:42:06 From Jiaxin Dai to Everyone : What does ‚Äúlate stage career‚Äùmean
12:42:42 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : 1) You have your set of power cards - each one denotes an element of our power that we can use. 2) Think about which power card you will play in this situation. Choose the one card that will help you most in this situation.When we send you to your breakout groups you will: 3) Play one card each. You will need to decide this amongst yourselves who in your group plays their card first.4) When you play your card, you will need to explain to your group why you believe that card is your strongest asset in that situation.5) The card you play must be different to the other cards played by people in your group. So, listen to the cards that people in your group have played and why.6) After you have all played the round, we will return you to the main room for the next step.
12:53:04 From Leah Lockhart (they/she) to Everyone : I am SO sorry Maartje and Stephanie!! I did not mean to leave the room so early. I pressed the button on accident :/
12:53:23 From St√©phanie Krus to Everyone : it‚Äôs fine Leah - We had 3 cards out of these 4
12:53:54 From Maartje Eigeman (zij/haar) - SDM to Everyone : Collectively we definitely won ;)
12:53:59 From Leah Lockhart (they/she) to Everyone : :)
12:54:07 From Li Min Ong to Everyone : So we're playing a power game here - fascinating
12:54:35 From Sam Villis to Everyone : Ugh - the one I was going to choose is up there but I tried to "play the game" and chose money and assets - now I have no money and assets!
12:54:47 From Jo Arthur to Everyone : I‚Äôm in the same place Sam!
12:54:54 From Lily Spek to Everyone : Ditto-ish, Sam
12:55:01 From Shahzma Haji (she/her) to Everyone : ^ me too, Sam :(
12:55:08 From Hannah Dickson to Everyone : Same here Sam! I didn't read the question well enough...
12:55:38 From Thea Snow to Everyone : That‚Äôs super interesting Sam et al
12:55:42 From Vinishree Solanki to Everyone : i have a question too
12:55:57 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Where you have a match, you‚Äôll draw two power cards of your choice from the list of ten (any ones you like) and add them to your cards. Where you don‚Äôt have a match, you‚Äôll set aside the card you‚Äôve just played (you won‚Äôt be able to use it again).
12:56:23 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Here are the cards again one more time https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/197xH4vsxEKFMfzTmr45AzmGBhyNxeCJr_VWCNoWu7BE/edit#slide=id.g8d75ee2853_0_228
12:56:24 From Ottawa Therapy Dogs to Everyone : Got it, love this
12:56:28 From Weixuan Zhang to Everyone : But if my card is not on the list
12:56:35 From Weixuan Zhang to Everyone : Can I add
12:56:41 From Weixuan Zhang to Everyone : More 2 card?
12:56:45 From Susanne Mueller (she/her) to Everyone : You just loose your card if it is not on the list
12:57:00 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Correct - if your card isn‚Äôt on the list, you lose it
12:57:03 From Lea Leimann to Everyone : Same here, like sam and the others‚Ä¶do you explain at some point why it is these 4 and not any other?
12:57:28 From Thea Snow to Everyone : It‚Äôs a great question, Lea. We don‚Äôt know why. We‚Äôd love to discuss this with Lauren!
12:57:39 From Thea Snow to Everyone : She‚Äôs asked for feedback - we‚Äôll pass that on
12:57:43 From Abe Greenspoon to Everyone : 12 cards. I feel so....something
12:57:56 From Lea Leimann to Everyone : Thanks! Would like to hear the answer, too!
12:58:04 From Weixuan Zhang to Everyone : When I loose the card like wellness and ability, need to choose another?
12:58:21 From Thea Snow to Everyone : No Weixuan. Unfortunately you just lose one
12:58:30 From Weixuan Zhang to Everyone : Oh no
12:58:37 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Your power inventory is lower :(
12:58:49 From Weixuan Zhang to Everyone : Got it
12:59:28 From Lily Spek to Everyone : 2 cards at once, or one at a time by turns?
12:59:39 From Vanessa Rodrigues to Everyone : We are 5 in our group
12:59:45 From Lily Spek to Everyone : thanks!
13:00:03 From Thea Snow to Everyone : 5 in a group is fine too
13:00:07 From Hannah Dickson to Everyone : Can we play our wildcard in this round?
13:00:14 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Not yet Hannah
13:00:54 From Vinishree Solanki to Everyone : I am enjoying this
13:07:54 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Where you have a match, in this round you‚Äôll draw four power cards of your choice from the list of ten (any ones you like) and add them to your cards. Where you don‚Äôt have a match, you‚Äôll set aside the card you‚Äôve just played (you won‚Äôt be able to use it again).
13:08:29 From Katie Saviano to Everyone : It‚Äôs interesting - the card ‚Äúpart of the majority group‚Äù would be one of the most helpful in the US for getting out of the prison system. I‚Äôm assuming this game wasn‚Äôt created in the US?
13:08:45 From Thea Snow to Everyone : @Katie - Lauren is from the US
13:08:51 From Katie Saviano to Everyone : Fascinating
13:09:13 From Dave Bell to Everyone : Yeah I chose that one thinking it would be the most powerful card!
13:09:34 From Faye Anderson to Everyone : Yes, that data is very clear...
13:09:35 From Wu Yue to Everyone : can you repeat the rule? I just lost the connection for a moment
13:09:56 From Hannah Dickson to Everyone : So interesting - I picked education and knowledge which I'm really surprised isn't helpful in this situation (I work *in* the justice system...)
13:10:03 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Where you have two matching, in this round you‚Äôll draw four power cards of your choice from the list of ten (any ones you like) and add them to your cards. Where you don‚Äôt have a match, you‚Äôll set aside both of the cards you‚Äôve just played (you won‚Äôt be able to use it again).
13:10:11 From Lily Spek to Everyone : the deck had 2 wildcard slides, hence the confusion perhaps =)
13:10:21 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : my mistake :)
13:10:30 From Abe Greenspoon to Everyone : Hannah me too. I agree, knowledge of the justice system would be a huge asset.
13:10:50 From Wu Yue to Everyone : Thanks Thea!
13:10:57 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Pleasure :)
13:19:35 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Hi @Carol Brown - are you just joining us, or did you drop off?
13:19:56 From Abe Greenspoon to Everyone : That was a rich conversation
13:20:02 From Carol Brown to Everyone : I just joined @Thea Snow
13:20:12 From Abe Greenspoon to Everyone : Thanks Cam, Alexis, Jemima
13:20:23 From Lily Spek to Everyone : Definitely losing so early in the morning felt bad, despite it not being real.
13:20:44 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Welcome @ Carol - we‚Äôre just about to go to a break. Happy to talk through instructions then, if that would be helpful?
13:20:51 From St√©phanie Krus to Everyone : dedending on your background and culture, you don‚Äôt interpret the card the same way, they means different thing to everyone and ‚Ä¶maybe its ok
13:21:04 From Leah Lockhart (they/she) to Everyone : We were two immigrants in discussion and we ended up focussing on how we interpret the cards or what they bring up for us in relation to the place we are now, the places we come from and the creator of the game being American.
13:21:52 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : we noticed the power structures at play within the group - as in, we wanted to be sure we were as equal as possible in the way the cards were played and who went first
13:21:57 From St√©phanie Krus to Everyone : how everyone wants to understand the rules, and expect very clear rules to play the game.
13:22:11 From Jiaxin Dai to Everyone : Even though we were all friendly, the power were not fairly distributed. There are always people with the most options and people who don't get to choose.
13:22:22 From Hannah Dickson to Everyone : We talked a lot about starting to play the game collectively (and possibly less honestly as a result?) rather than individually 
13:22:43 From MaryCate to Everyone : we noticed that I was refreshing to have the space and permission to talk about power in our group, and how we never actually do it/have permission anywhere else
13:22:45 From Deepika Grover to Everyone : Is integrity and honesty contrary to power?
13:22:48 From Lily Spek to Everyone : Really interesting to participate today, after being through a trial run of an intro to targeted universalism.
13:22:55 From Esther_meng to Everyone : these power most people obviously don't have in real life. For criminal situation, what we see normally is  general people appeal and wait for the long precess
13:23:35 From AÃÅlvaro Vargas to Everyone : I found myself getting into the role playing but situating the players in my own sociocultural context, which is power in itself, coming from that political North.
13:24:02 From Leah Lockhart (they/she) to Everyone : Whoa, Lily. ‚ÄòTargeted universalism‚Äô just blew my mind a little bit.
13:24:22 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : @Leah ikr! Love it Lily
13:24:35 From Farrah Nazir to Everyone : I have to jump off I‚Äôm afraid!! Thank you for hosting!
13:24:42 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Thanks Farrah!
13:24:56 From Lily Spek to Everyone : It was an intro workshop and they were testing it, so we got to reflect on how we were learning and I love thinking about that in relation to power.
13:24:57 From Alexis Pala to Everyone : Thanks Abe! It was lovely having you in our group!
13:25:00 From Hannah Dickson to Everyone : So many of the cards dictate the the situation to begin with, even if it doesn't play out in the subsequent conversations...
13:25:36 From Ottawa Therapy Dogs to Everyone : Hi, Antonia here .. I am also need to take off! I‚Äôve really enjoyed this event! Thank you again for hosting!! Great job!
13:26:05 From √Ösa Holmberg to Everyone : Hi Jo!
13:26:09 From √Ösa Holmberg to Everyone : Kia ora
13:26:15 From √Ösa Holmberg to Everyone : Sleep tight
13:31:39 From MaryCate to Everyone : Yes - everything new and interesting and moving at pace again. Hope you had a great break
13:32:43 From jax wechsler to Everyone : Got to step away. Thanks! very interesting.
13:33:59 From Thea Snow to Everyone : Thanks Jax
13:34:50 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : and we are playing only 1 card this time, yes?
13:34:54 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : yes
13:35:10 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : If you or someone in the group plays a wildcard, you must decide to what to do about the wildcard (before returning to the main room). If as a group, you decide that the wildcard played trumps all other cards, then that person wins the round, even if other people in the group have a matching card. So, how will you use your power in this scenario?
13:46:38 From Camille Furtado to Everyone : oh we didn't decide if ours trumped
13:47:10 From √Ösa Holmberg to Everyone : We didn‚Äôt  either. The wildcard was ‚Äùbeing born in a country with at free healthcare system‚Äù.
13:47:57 From St√©phanie Krus to Everyone : I‚Äôm so full of power mwoua-ha-ha!
13:48:01 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : What did this game bring up for you?What did this game make you realise about how you might use power in real life?What mechanisms are there for equalising power?Based on the decisions of the group, what type of society do you think you‚Äôd end up in? What does this mean for the power you may have or the power others may give you because of who you are?
13:48:56 From Thea Snow to Everyone : What did you notice as your inventory grew/shrunk?
13:49:01 From Sam Villis to Everyone : Is everyone in breakouts or is my zoom messed up?
13:49:14 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : we've just left breakouts, Sam
13:49:31 From Sam Villis to Everyone : Ah, sound just loaded in. Thanks
13:49:50 From Jemima Gibbons to Everyone : Can you reshare questions in the chat?
13:49:56 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : What did this game bring up for you?What did this game make you realise about how you might use power in real life?What mechanisms are there for equalising power?Based on the decisions of the group, what type of society do you think you‚Äôd end up in? What does this mean for the power you may have or the power others may give you because of who you are?
13:50:03 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : What did you notice as your inventory grew/shrunk?
13:52:14 From Lea Leimann to Everyone : I‚Äôve just seen ‚Äömy power cards‚Äò, not how many cards others had. Seeing this imbalance would have probably changed my feelings
13:52:39 From Jade Richardson to Everyone : I started to get more and more unsettled as I lost each round and didn‚Äôt gain any power cards - and really felt at a disadvantage each new round with having less ‚Äòpower‚Äô and less to pick from
13:52:44 From AÃÅlvaro Vargas to Everyone : I found that this exercise foregrounded a lot of the intersectionalities  around the use of power in a situation and what to consider. Especially when I am trying to stay within my personal values
13:53:30 From Hannah Dickson to Everyone : I became more generous the more cards I lost! Perhaps increasing desperation / awareness of reliance on others to share their power(s)?
13:53:33 From Lily Spek to Everyone : @Jade agree. It felt like compounding loss, and a narrowing of what's possible.
13:53:35 From Alexis Pala to Everyone : I am reflecting on how it would have felt to all start with the random cards ‚Äòwe were dealt‚Äô rather than starting with a full deck and being forced to play the only cards I had since being able to strategise is a privilege
13:53:49 From Leah Lockhart (they/she) to Everyone : We agreed at the first round to be a collective, which we kept throughout. We went rogue and it was beautiful! We were the change we want to see :)
13:54:12 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : so true @Alexis
13:54:26 From Vanessa Rodrigues to Everyone : +1 Alexis
13:54:35 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : awww @Leah! <3
13:54:42 From Jemima Gibbons to Everyone : Love that idea @Leah!
13:54:43 From √Ösa Holmberg to Everyone : Would be great if you could read out loud some of the discussion here in the chat.
13:54:47 From Vanessa Rodrigues to Everyone : +1 Lea Leimann
13:55:08 From Vanessa Rodrigues to Everyone : Would love to hear how that worked Leah!
13:55:22 From Katie Johns (she/her) to Everyone : It was interesting to see which cards people stockpiled as the game progressed.
13:55:33 From Mark Buttanshaw to Everyone : Agree @Alexis - and especially would be interesting if dealt cards unevenly with some people starting with more than others
13:55:45 From Alexis Pala to Everyone : I am also really curious to know which cards people would play given their positionally. I never played the majority group card and I wonder if that is due to my own lived experience
13:55:55 From Emily Robertson to Everyone : I have to go join another meeting. Thanks Nour, Thea, and everyone!
13:56:06 From Sam Yuen (they/she) to Everyone : In Round 02, it became more obvious to me which power cards I perceived to be more powerful, and I decided to pick 1 ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù + 1 ‚Äúless powerful‚Äù so that those going after me had ‚Äúmore choices‚Äù (obvs all my assessments).
13:56:09 From Amy Morris to Everyone : We were able to shift the power dynamic somewhat by switching up the order of players each round.
13:56:32 From Vinishree Solanki to Everyone : Wildcard was a surprise, and many interesting perceptions arose which enriched the conversations 
13:56:38 From Nour Sidawi to Everyone : How did you interpret how to play the game? Did you play as yourself or in the world you would want to live in?
13:56:38 From Jo Arthur to Everyone : I‚Äôve got to drop off now, thanks everyone! It was a really interesting session :)
13:56:41 From Alexis Pala to Everyone : Yes Katie! I didn‚Äôt see that but kept winning and found it strange to be able to choose what I wanted to accumulate more of
13:57:15 From Brigette Metzler to Everyone : it was interesting how little money mattered, or, how infrequently we chose it. Perhaps because of privilege in the group?
13:57:15 From Wu Yue to Everyone : we also have reverse order
13:57:41 From Leah Lockhart (they/she) to Everyone : Defo @Alexis. Point about what choices we made given positionality. I‚Äôve been thinking about that too.
13:57:44 From Sam Yuen (they/she) to Everyone : @Brigette and cultural contexts
13:58:13 From Lea Leimann to Everyone : Jiaxin proposed in our group that the one who just lost cards would go first this time
13:58:28 From Jess Callaghan to Everyone : +1 Alexis, that would be a really interesting variation!
13:58:33 From Deepika Grover to Everyone : How did you interpret how to play the game? And how you made choices about the cards you chose?
13:58:39 From Alexis Pala to Everyone : We did that too @Lea
13:58:41 From Sinead Dumigan to Everyone : It feels like there is sometimes more power with extroverts - as they are comfortable with being vocal and having a voice and introverts aren‚Äôt as happy to do so
13:58:59 From Vinishree Solanki to Everyone : It was easier to play as 'me at this moment'
13:59:12 From Hannah Dickson to Everyone : The collective 'success' depends entirely on how others choose to play the game too
13:59:43 From Alexis Pala to Everyone : Sorry cannot speak out loud at the moment :) but really interested to know what people‚Äôs wildcards were before and during the round. I wrote down a wildcard that I decided not to play
13:59:56 From St√©phanie Krus to Everyone : Sorry need to go but it was great and I‚Äôve enjoyed both the breakoutroom and people‚Äôs interventions. Thanks a lot for the opportunnity - lots of ideas!!!
13:59:59 From √Ösa Holmberg to Everyone : This is so important when we design digital services for public sector. That we need to have everyone with us in the design process. If only privileged people design services for people that have less power, the services will not be as good. If you can wait 4 months for your money, you might not understand that velocity is important for other people. So they can feed their kids.
