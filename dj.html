D. Sean</strong></a> or as <a href="assets/images/sd/Abolish-the-Cop-Insider-Your-Designer-Head.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PDF</a></p>
    <p>Some highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>policing targets non-criminal behavior (drinking in public) and low-level crimes ("graffiti, public urination, panhandling, littering, and unlicensed street vending") in public spaces. Policing criminalizes individuals for simply existing, or being poor, inpublic</li>
        <li>Research shows that even the act of reading all of the privacy policies to which one is exposed online would take the average adult 76 working days per year,market. As Sarah T. Hamid put it, privacy is "less like a design value, and more like a luxury demand”</li>
        <li>Designers have been taught that they can perform acts of empathy, such as suggesting that a designer can learn about the disabled experience by walking around blindfolded or on crutches, instead of centering the lived experiences of people with disabilities. The concept of empathy has been bastardized so much that rarely do designers actually willfully surrender power in order to be empathetic.</li>
        <li>The mental models of design continue to privilege white, Western, European, post-colonial, post-imperialist frameworks, norms, and cultural expressions. 
            This led some to posit that design and design thinking protect white supremacy by perpetuating characteristics of white supremacy culture. 
            These characteristics include perfectionism, a sense of urgency, defensiveness, valuing quantity over quality, worship of the written word, belief in only one right way, paternalism,
            either/or thinking, power hoarding, fear of open conflict, individualism, belief that "I'm the only one who can do this right,"
            belief that progress is bigger and more, belief in objectivity, and claiming a right to comfort. Others have extended this analysis and argued that design thinking and its modernist roots are merely a rebrand for white supremacy</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="https://dscout.com/people-nerds/sarah-fathallah" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Every Space is Political</strong></a></p>
    <p>It’s also important to understand what it means to be in service of a community, and by extension to the team members who are from that community. When I'm leading a team working in a community that isn’t mine, non-hierarchical leadership means enabling team members to nurture and hold onto relationships way after I'm gone. This can look like doing childcare, coordinating transportation vouchers, taking notes, or doing whatever it takes to create the space and skill-sets for other people to do the literal work of community building.</p>
    <p>This is tied to how many thinkers—mainly Indigenous people—are challenging how epistemology needs to have a Western foundation, or otherwise it’s not valid. International development as a whole has a deeply rooted history in imperialism and neo-colonial practices. It's this idea that you bring in expertise from Anglo-Saxon and Euro-centric centers of knowledge that you then take to other communities. Then you “support” or “help” them. It’s paternalistic, patronizing, and transactional.</p>
    <p>We were drafting our language around seeking informed consent. The translator was using a proverb: “You cannot force a dog to run.” This proverb explains how you can't force someone to do something, and that's how they explained the idea of informed consent to someone.</p>
    <p>This was also a community that has a huge presence of international development actors, so a lot of people experienced research fatigue. They're asked to participate in projects all the time. And so they often said, "Why are you talking to me? Just go talk to the healthcare worker," or whoever. So there was a proverb that we used to explain why we wanted to do more participatory research approaches. It was something along the lines of “Whoever lives in the house is the only one who knows where the water leaks.” We could tap into the power of a phrase that just in one sentence communicates so much more than what I could have done in a few dry and unfamiliar paragraphs.</p>
    <p>There's not a single project where I felt any smarter or any more insightful than any single person that I've engaged with. That's not only not true, but it also stems from a hierarchical way of categorizing relationships which is devaluing of participants’ own knowledge and expertise.</p>
    <p>I think working in the social sector forces you to be a lot more reflective about your positionality, your biases, and the privilege that you bring into your work. It just pushes you to not rely on what you've learned at school as the end all be all of what you need to know.</p>
    <p>Adrienne Maree Brown has this wonderful quote in Emergent Strategy that says, "Move at the speed of trust." And working in the social sector relies on building trust, building relationships, and creating the space for what it means to seek mutual liberation. You can't do that in a short amount of time. You can't do that in the pace that typical design or design research engagements are done in the private sector.</p>
    <p>When I work in the social sector, I try to come in as a whole person that doesn't have this artificial separation. I come in with my full immigrant, my queer, my feminist, my person of color selves into the work.</p>
    <p>There’s the Maya Angelou quote that goes, "Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better." Except it's not a destination, it’s a journey. I'm continually being like, "Well, the way that I was used to doing this thing, I can't do that anymore." Even the other day, I learned to challenge the fact that maybe inclusion isn't the point because the people who are doing the “including” are still upholding deeply asymmetric power dynamics by holding the privilege to set the terms for what inclusivity means.</p>
