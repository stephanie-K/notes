# My notes
This website is to organise my notes on various subjects:
- **UX**     (notes added regularly from various reading)
- **UR**     (done)
- **Accessibility**     (more notes to add from one IDF ongoing course)
- **Frontend Development**     (done)
- **Content**     (more to add once I've read Sarah Richards' book and 'Content Strategy for the web') 
- **Technologies**     (done)

This is just for me
