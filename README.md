# My notes
This website is to organise my notes on various subjects:
- **UX** (more old notes to add and notes added regularly from various reading)
- **UR** (more notes to add from one IDF ongoing course)
- **Accessibility** (more notes to add from one IDF ongoing course)
- **Frontend Development** (only part that is finished for now)
- **Content** (more to add once I've read Sarah Richards' book and 'Content Strategy for the web') 
- **Technologies** (notes on google analytics to add once tutorial finished)

this is just for me
