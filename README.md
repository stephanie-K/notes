# My notes
This website is to organise my notes on various subjects:
- **UX**    
- **UR**   
- **Accessibility**     
- **Frontend Development**     
- **Content**     (more to add once I've read Sarah Richards' book and 'Content Strategy for the web') 
- **Technologies**    

This is just for me. More is added on a regular basis from various readings.
