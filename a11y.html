          <h1>Notes on Accessibility</h1>

          <p><strong>In the UK, 1 in 5 people have a disability</strong> – this could be visual, hearing, motor or cognitive (affecting memory and thinking). But the concept of accessibility doesn’t just apply to people with disabilities – all users will have different needs at different times and in different circumstances. <br>
            For example: location (noise, slow wifi) health (tired, recovering) equipment (mobile or older browser).<br>
            Assisted digital support: helping user with low digital skills, or limited access. There are 14% in the red on the digital inclusion scale.
          </p>
          <p class="red">Making things more accessible makes things better for all users</p>
          <p>

            <p>The ultimate objective of Visability93 isn’t to atomize the current ISA into hundreds of icons or replace it with a new one. Instead, the idea is to create a modifiable visual language that can be adapted to include less visible disabilities if someone so wishes. In the end, the duo hopes to educate people around the issue—and fight the discrimination faced by people who “don’t look disabled.”</p>

            <p>10 Principles of Accessibility for Web and Mobile Design<br>
              <ul>
                <li>blind gets 80% of accessibility issues (includes low vision and colour blindness)</li>
                <li>alt text (don't need to say 'image' and only say what is relevant (also important to SEO) - keep it to 50 characters long max, if not need then do" alt="" so screen readers ignore them</li>
                <li>hamburger menu are usually not accessible</li>
                <li>content placed 'out of the way' won't be found or seen</li>
                <li>accessibility testing with users can reveal huge gaps (don't just use checkers)</li>
                <li>disabling zoom on mobile makes it inaccessible</li>
                <li>accessibility is easily learned (to code for it) and cheap if done up front</li>
                <li>accessibility doesn't mean ugly - visual bias is your worse enemy</li>
                <li>check mobile accessibility separately (including responsive issues (collapse/expand can be lost, especially with magnification)</li>
                <li>embrace the access attitude: people first, clear purpose with well defined goals, solid structure (standards), easy interaction, helpful wayfinding, clean presentation, plain language (create da conversation), accessible media</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Accessibility impact SEO: the better the experience (time on site) and less barriers is considered good by algorithms (like google)</p>
            <p>Trying to navigate a site after a poor night sleep, or after a beer can put you in a good place to test how cognitively impaired people might be ;)</p>
            <p> checkers are good but do not replace testing: constrast (contrast checker tool WCAG 2), colour blind checkers (Vischeck). Sometimes, they raise issue that are not that important so you don't need to fix all.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>perceivable: </strong>information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can see or hear</li>
              <li><strong>operable: </strong>UI components and navigation must be designed so that users can interact with them and they can support assistive tehcnologies such as screen readers</li>
              <li><strong>understandable: </strong>information and the operation of the UI must communicate clearly and consistently so that the content is readable</li>
              <li><strong>robust: </strong>content must be written so that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistives tehcnologies</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">Compliance requirement A, AA, AAA</p>
            <p>AA is the standard most used. A is low (essential for basic accessibility), AA is moderate and AAA is the highest (Gold standard).</p>

            <p>Inclusive design is a methodology that is about valuing a diversity of experiences and abilities in the development of a product as well as in its future use. Designers should recognize that when accessibility issues are an add-on after the product has been developed, it is actually too late.</p>
            <p>Reframing the definition of disability from a health condition or personal attribute to, “a mismatch between the needs of an individual and a product, service, social structure, culture, or environment is huge because we all experience these mismatches on a day-to-day level whether they’re permanent, temporary or situational.</p>

            <p><strong>Inclusive design methods are a great addition to human-centered design methodologies. </strong></p>
            <p>Learning how people adapt to the world around them means spending time understanding their experience from their perspective.<br>
            When done well, we can recognise more than just the barriers that people encounter. We also recognise the motivations that all people have in common.</p>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Designing for accessibility is not that hard</strong></a></p>
            <p>Digital accessibility refers to the practice of building digital content and applications that can be used by a wide range of people, including individuals who have visual, motor, auditory, speech, or cognitive disabilities.</p>
            <p>There is a strong business case for accessibility: studies show that accessible websites have better search results, they reach a bigger audience, they’re SEO friendly, have faster download times, they encourage good coding practices, and they always have better usability.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>add enough colour contrast: </strong>According to the W3C, the contrast ratio between text and its background should be at least 4.5 to 1 (conformance level AA.) The ratios become more forgiving with larger and heavier fonts since they’re easier to read at lower contrast. If your type is at least 18 pt or 14 pt bold, the minimum contrast ratio drops to 3 to 1</li>
                <li><strong>don’t use color alone to make critical information understandable: </strong>Try to use an indicator other than color such as text labels or patterns. When showing errors on the screen, don’t rely on colored text alone, add an icon or include a title to the message. Consider adding a visual cue such as font weight or underline text style to linked text in a paragraph, so the links stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>have clear focus indicators : </strong>People with visual and motoric disabilities should be able to navigate without a mouse or trackpad. Created focus indicators that are straight forward and obvious for all so that regardless of your level of ability, you can use a website or apps with clarity.</li>
                <li><strong>use labels or instructions with form fields and inputs: </strong>Always help people understand what they should do and write in a form. It’s best if labels don’t go away, even when the person is filling an input; people should never lose context with what they’re writing. People who use screen readers usually navigate through a form using the Tab key to jump through the form controls. The &lt;label&gt; elements are read for each form control. Any non-label text, as placeholder text, is usually skipped over.</li>
                <li><strong>write useful alternative text for your images and other non-text content: </strong>Try to describe what’s happening in the image, and how it matters to the story, rather than just saying something like “picture,” context is everything.<br>
                    If the image is purely decorative or if it creates redundancy because the surrounding context already explains the content. Then adding an empty <alt> attribute will make screen readers skip it. If you don’t write any alt text, some screen readers will read the file name to the individual.</li>
                <li><strong>use correct markup on your content: </strong>Headings mark where the content starts — they’re tags given to text to define its style and purpose. Headings also establish the hierarchy of the content of the page.<br>
                    Titles with big font sizes help a reader understand the order of the content better. Likewise, screen readers also use heading tags to read content. This way, people with low-vision get an overview of the page by reading each heading in a hierarchal flow.<br>
                    It’s important to use proper structural elements when you develop a site. HTML elements communicate to the browser what kind of content they contain and how the browser should render or treat that content. The components and structure of a page are what arranges an accessibility tree. This tree is what powers screen readers which are used by people who are blind so they can “listen” to a page.</li>
                <li><strong>use strong typographic hierarchy: </strong>good typography is the key to good design. Ensure that typographic hierarchy makes sense without the use of too many different of shades of grays. Rely on strong type sizing and bolding to create a meaningful hierarchy so that information makes sense at a glance. Enabled support for dynamic font sizes. This way you can use the default accessibility feature to change the size of the text to what suits you best.</li>
               <li><strong>support keyboard navigation: </strong>Keyboard accessibility is one of the most critical aspects of web accessibility. People with motor disabilities, blind people that rely on screen readers, people that don’t have precise muscle control, and even power users are dependent on a keyboard to navigate content.<br>
                The focus state that we discussed before provides a visual indicator of the component that is currently selected.<br>
                As you navigate through a page, the order of the interactive elements is essential, and the navigation must be logical and intuitive. The tab order should follow the visual flow of the page: left to right, top to bottom — header, main navigation, content buttons and inputs, and finally the footer.<br>
                Be careful with the size of your navigation — this includes the number of links and the length of the text. Tabbing through long menus may be demanding for people with motor disabilities. And listening to lengthy links can be cumbersome for people that use screen readers—try to be concise. Providing ARIA landmarks or HTML5 structural elements like &lt;main&gt; or &lt;nav&gt; will make navigation easier. </li>
                <li><strong>use SVGs: </strong>Replace PNGs with SVGs so that icons and UI components render clear and sharp when you use the built-in zooming feature that’s available on most operating systems and browsers. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>These guidelines will help you make your web design get closer to meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. There are 3 levels A is the lowest, AAA is the higest. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More info about level of conformance here.</a></p>
            
            <p class="lead">The developing approach to service building at GOV.UK</p>
            <p> The assisted digital team found that usually we default to and encourage service builders to segment users in a way that blocks inclusive service building:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>digital user: </strong>can use an online service independently</li>
              <li><strong>assisted digital users: </strong>can’t and receive help offline to do things online</li>
              <li><strong>non-digital, non-user: </strong>can’t and use a separate, offline way to do things</li>
              <li><strong>accessibility-related user: </strong>with disabilities or impairments</li>
            </ul>
           <p><strong>There is also a segmentation by channel:</strong></p>
           <p>There are useful things to know when delivering services over specific channels, for example how to handle data securely online. But channels are just the medium between government and citizens, often chosen as a symptom of other factors, for example picking up the phone because a website crashes, or going to a local Citizens Advice because you couldn’t understand what was being said over the phone.<br>
              The channel is not the user, and we found that segmenting users by the channel they’re using <strong>leads to exclusive design</strong>. For example, digital service builders work hard to ensure online content is comprehensible and measurable, but much less hard, or not at all, to make telephone content the same.<br>
              Designers do the hardest work to make online stuff simple. Yet the greatest needs and highest costs are around offline interactions.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Inclusive segments for inclusive service building:</strong></p>
            <p>We reviewed the reasons why users of all characteristics, on all channels might struggle or fail to successfully use a service, and found that all of us, all users, share areas of limited capacity:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>time available</li>
              <li>financial situation</li>
              <li>ease of physically access to an interface (including a person)</li>
              <li>interface capability</li>
              <li>awareness of the service and access options</li>
              <li>ability to comprehend information</li>
              <li>mental health / emotional capacity</li>
              <li>trust in service robustness, security, reliability</li>
              <li>ability to provide required information</li>
              <li>self-confidence to be able to do what’s required of them</li>
              <li>willingness to use the service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We think that approaching guidance around these universally applicable areas will better encourage and enable service builders to build services that are inclusive and work properly for all.</p>

            <p><a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2018/03/20/why-accessibility-testing-with-real-users-is-so-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Why testing with real user is so important</strong></a></p>
            <p>Once an assistive technology user can find a rhythm that works for them, they tend to stick to it. For Dragon users this often means <strong>dictating their speech into a single long Word document</strong>, where it is easy to see and edit, and then transferring it into the various dialogue boxes in their web browser.</p>
            <p>For JAWS users a dossier of case material prepared and saved into PDF was far easier to read than piecemeal material in various formats under a host of different tabs.</p>
            <p>Try to make any content – including lists of options – <strong>as concise as possible </strong>so that it can be quickly understood.</p>
            <p>No one reads every word on every page. We’re looking for the gist. Screen reader users are no different. In fact experienced <strong>users often like to speed up the reading rate to 300 words per minute</strong> or more. This is their equivalent of scanning the page.</p>
            <p>Lots of lines and global navigation create tedium and should allow for easy skipping, ideally in one go, for example with the <strong>‘Skip Navigation’</strong> link.</p>
            <p><strong>Links need to go somewhere</strong><br>
              It sounds obvious, but with widgets and compartmentalised page content, clicking a link will often update just a section of the page. This is great for sighted users who will spot such a difference. But not for a screen reader user.<br>
              There are ways to avoid this issue. You <strong>could ensure that the new content is announced by the screen reader by using ARIA live regions or by moving focus to the updated content.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Designers and developers should implement the solution that provides the best user experience. This will depend on the particular design, content and functionality of the page.<br>
                  <strong>Offer a linear and obvious layout</strong><br>
                  One of the screens we tested had been designed full of embedded, progressive logic. Each time a user answered a question, yet another nested level of questions appeared, depending on how they’d answered the previous question.  3 levels in our screen reader users had no idea which question they were answering anymore.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Include integration with other software such as Word and Adobe Acrobat</strong><br>
                  Even if your system is web-based, if you are relying on other software, such as <strong> Word or PDF</strong>, for downloading or viewing material, you must include this in your testing.<br>
                  In our testing, every Dragon user’s Word software crashed when they tried to download documents. With screen readers, pop-up dialogues to save/open docs in Word were ignored, leaving them stranded.
              </p>
              <p>Problems experienced by assistive technology users are often also experienced by all users<br>
                  When we tested with assistive technology users, we found them struggling with overly complex screens, missing key pieces of information and struggling to download and open documents.<br>
                  We found exactly the same thing when we tested with people who weren’t using assistive technology. <br>
                  <span class="red">Testing with people who use assistive technology can be a quick and effective way of identifying issues that affect all users.</span>

            <p><strong>The Principles of Universal Design</strong> is a foundation for designers who set out to create Universal Design products. The principles were created to guide a wide range of design disciplines including environments, products, and communications. You can apply these principles to any design style or trend; they are timeless and adaptable. You will be proactively taking on accessibility by incorporating these principles at the beginning of a project.</p>
            <p>There are seven principles, and they all include guidelines with actionable approaches for Universal Design. Each principle captures a key concept. Whenever you are using the guidelines to plan and evaluate your design, an important thing to note is that sometimes only a few of the seven principles will be relevant to your current design. In the following section, you'll learn about each of the seven principles and its guidelines. Additionally, we will look at design examples for each principle so you can apply these immediately to your projects.</p>
