          <h1>Notes on Accessibility</h1>

          <p><strong>In the UK, 1 in 5 people have a disability</strong> – this could be visual, hearing, motor or cognitive (affecting memory and thinking). But the concept of accessibility doesn’t just apply to people with disabilities – all users will have different needs at different times and in different circumstances. <br>
            For example: location (noise, slow wifi) health (tired, recovering) equipment (mobile or older browser).<br>
            Assisted digital support: helping user with low digital skills, or limited access. There are 14% in the red on the digital inclusion scale.
          </p>
          <p class="red">Making things more accessible makes things better for all users</p>
          <p><strong>What is Digital Accessibility?: </strong><br>
          "Digital accessibility is the ability of a website, mobile application or electronic document to be easily navigated and understood by a wide range of users, including those users who have visual, auditory, motor or cognitive disabilities."
        </p>

            <p>The ultimate objective of Visability93 isn’t to atomize the current ISA into hundreds of icons or replace it with a new one. Instead, the idea is to create a modifiable visual language that can be adapted to include less visible disabilities if someone so wishes. In the end, the duo hopes to educate people around the issue—and fight the discrimination faced by people who “don’t look disabled.”</p>

            <p class=margin-top-2><strong>HTML5, CSS + Aria</strong></p>
            <p>HTML has historically lacked some key semantic markers, such as the ability to designate sections of the page as the header, navigation, main content and footer. <br>
            With HTML5, these designations are possible, using the new elements for it: header, nav, main, and footer.<br>
            Similar functionality is available using the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Application) attributes role="banner", role="navigation" and role="contentinfo"
            </p>
            <p>ARIA provides a way to specify roles for documents areas and more. The available Document Landmark Roles are: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>banner: site-orientated content, such as the name of the website, title of the page, and or logo</li>
              <li>navigation: the area that contains the navigation links for the document or website</li>
              <li>main: the main or central content of the doucment</li>
              <li>search: this section contains the search functionality for the website</li>
              <li>article: stand alone content that makes sense out of context from the rest of the document. Example might be blog posting, a comment on a blog, a forum post, etc... Specifically, a blog posting might be identified as an article and individual blog comments might also be marked up with a role of article within that blog posting</li>
              <li>complementary: supporting content for the main content</li>
              <li>contentinfo: informational child content, such as footnotes, copyrights, links to privacy statement, links to preferences and so on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="assets/images/a11y/aria1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/a11y/aria1.png"/></a></p>
            <p><strong>Keyboard</strong></p>
            <p>Try tabbing through and make sure, space bar (selecting), arrows keys, enter work as expected, that the tab order is logical, and focus indicator is always visible to sighted keyboard users, provide proper heading structure and ARIA landmarks.</p>
            <p>Note that an &lt;a&gt; element is only keyboard accessible when it has a non empty href attribute</p>
            <p>outline: 0 kills keyboard accessibility</p>
            <p>Watch out for conflicts with A.T. by staying clear from the following types of assignments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Caps Lock + any other combination of Keys</li>
              <li>insert + any other combination of other Keys</li>
              <li>scroll Lock + any other combination of other Keys</li>
              <li>macOS only: Control+Option + any other combination of other Keys</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If in doubt, mimic the standard desktop behaviour of the control you are creating.</p>

            <p class="margin-top-2"><strong>Focusability</strong> = sensible structure, to reduce the tab overhead to remove the fatigue. Needs to be decided ahead of the design</p>
            <p>Focus = directing keyboard events to a selected element</p>
            <p>If non-interactive = no need to add focusability, if there are interactive controls = add focus</p>
            <p>Focus is the visual and physical result of making commonly used keys active.It help users stay (focused) on tasks.</p>
            <p>Focus assignment:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>direct focus: direct to content, to support the user's task. Otherwise screen reader will read what's behind on overlay / pop up etc...</li>
              <li>retain focus: focus rings can be unpredictable so devs assign (outline: none , don't do this!) instead try: focus-ring (new CSS selector) differentiates mouse + keyboard focus</li>
              <li>prevent focus: use inert attribute (user won't be able to access</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An ARIA live region is a simple mechanism for notifying screen readers when content is updated on the page. Despite the obvious Accessible User Experience (AUX) benefits that live regions bring, screen reader support is disappointingly inconsistent.</p>
            <p>The aria-live attribute identifies an element as a live region. It takes three possible values:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Off (no notification)</li>
              <li>Polite (screen reader notifies user once current task is complete)</li>
              <li>Assertive (screen reader interrupts current task to notify user)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: Assistive technologies will announce dynamic changes in the content of a live region. The live region must first be present (and usually empty), so that the browser and assistive technologies are aware of it. Any subsequent changes are then announced.</p>

            <p>3 potential problems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Long texts will be a problem for magnifier like ZoomText (may appear on two lines and confuse the user thinking it’s two different options)</li>
              <li>Dragon  (speech converter) uses a special way to input text that wasn’t expected by the autocomplete functionality</li>
              <li>These lists can be very long and an item very low in the list can be hard to pick for someone with motricity issues</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">What can subtitles and text do? and not do?</p>
            <p>Subtitles or captions for hard of hearing people provide text information on the screen that is only available through sound. As well as providing a text transcription of what is being said, captions can explain which character is speaking and that, for example a telephone is ringing or a dog is barking. Text cannot however convey the tone, pitch and intonation of a voice</p>
            
            <p class="lead">TV captioning</p> 
            <p>Only two lines of text are provided for TV captions and so when people are speaking very quickly the text may disappear from the screen too quickly to be able to read</p>
            <p>TV captioners therefore often simplify the captions rather than present verbatim captions. Pre-prepared block captions can be used for recorded videos, whereas scrolling captions are used for live captioning which are harder to read</p>
            <p>Highly trained captioners using chorded phonetic keyboards are necessary for verbatim captioning of very fast speech (e.g. 200 words per minute), whereas repeating and simplifying what is being said using speech recognition can be used for slower speech rates</p>
            <p>Accuracy measures normally simply count the number of errors in captions without taking into account the relative importance of the words in conveying meaning. This makes it very difficult to measure the accuracy of simplified captions and compare them with verbatim captions</p>
            
            <p class="lead">Web captioning</p>  
            <p>On the web it is possible to provide many more lines of text than on a TV and also to automatically identify which word is being spoken through underlining or highlighting</p>
            <p class="lead">Foreign language subtitles</p>  
            <p>Foreign language subtitles are used to present a text translation into a target language from the language being spoken in the video. It is cheaper than providing the spoken soundtrack in the target language</p>

            <p class="lead">Sign language</p> 
            <p>Sign language is required by Deaf viewers whose first language is sign language and who may find reading captions too difficult. Every country has its own sign language</p>

            <p class="lead">Audio description</p> 
            <p>Audio description is used to provide a spoken description of important information that is only available visually</p>
            <p>This information is presented when there is no other information being presented through speech or sound and so the short time available often means that only descriptions that are absolutely essential to understanding can be provided</p>
            <p>Web systems are available that pause the video to allow extra time for the audio description</p>
            <p>When listening to an audio with no video then all the spoken information required can be provided by a transcript. It is much faster to read a transcript than listen to spoken information presented at normal speed</p>
            <p>Unlike captions, a transcript for a video however, cannot convey which text corresponds with which sounds and which images</p>
            <p>Captions are also very popular with many people who have no disability, as they can help with the understanding of what is being said for example when there is a low sound level and/or a high background noise level</p>
            <p>There can be different regulations for captions or audio descriptions for broadcasters in different countries for both TV and internet. These may vary in terms of the accuracy, number of hours, types of broadcasts and the times they are shown</p>

            <p class="lead">Transcript</p>
            <p>They are really good as it's easy to use of the broadband is not great (compare to a video) you can search it and it's quicker to read it than to listen to it</p>

            <p>Some contrast levels of print on different backgrounds, font styles and size of print, plus the overall look and feel may cause increased reading difficulties.</p>
            <p>Some individuals find the option to change screen colours with a virtual overlay or via a different background colour may help. Both these changes can be achieved through the use of bookmarks, plugins or toolbars in browsers. </p>
            <p>The position of the text on the screen is also important - avoiding clutter and making good use of white space to delineate particular points in the content can assist all readers. In English text that is left justified with a ragged right edge allows the reader to keep an eye on where they have reached on a long page or text, whereas justified text such as may be seen in a newspaper column, provides no such guide.</p>
            <p>Some guides also suggest restricting the width of lines to around 60-70 characters such as the updated BDA Style Guide which is backed by research, although some people find even narrower columns can help increase reading speeds.</p>
            <p>Individual preferences need to be considered and there are readers who find narrow fonts with very little character spacing hard to cope with although research has shown this is not so much of an issue as line spacing. However, choosing a sans serif font, such as Arial or Verdana with increased letter spacing, can increase readability generally.</p>

            <p>10 Principles of Accessibility for Web and Mobile Design<br>
              <ul>
                <li>blind gets 80% of accessibility issues (includes low vision and colour blindness)</li>
                <li><a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>alt text</strong></a> (don't need to say 'image' and only say what is relevant (also important to SEO) - keep it to 50 characters long max, if not need then do" alt="" so screen readers ignore them. <a href="https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Axess Lab guidance about alt text</strong></a></li>
                <li>hamburger menu are usually not accessible</li>
                <li>content placed 'out of the way' won't be found or seen</li>
                <li>accessibility testing with users can reveal huge gaps (don't just use checkers)</li>
                <li>disabling zoom on mobile makes it inaccessible</li>
                <li>accessibility is easily learned (to code for it) and cheap if done up front</li>
                <li>accessibility doesn't mean ugly - visual bias is your worse enemy</li>
                <li>check mobile accessibility separately (including responsive issues (collapse/expand can be lost, especially with magnification)</li>
                <li>embrace the access attitude: people first, clear purpose with well defined goals, solid structure (standards), easy interaction, helpful wayfinding, clean presentation, plain language (create da conversation), accessible media</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Accessibility impact SEO: the better the experience (time on site) and less barriers is considered good by algorithms (like google)</p>
            <p>Trying to navigate a site after a poor night sleep, or after a beer can put you in a good place to test how cognitively impaired people might be ;)</p>
            <p> checkers are good but do not replace testing: constrast (contrast checker tool WCAG 2), colour blind checkers (Vischeck). Sometimes, they raise issue that are not that important so you don't need to fix all.</p>

            <p class="lead">Inclusive Design strategies and tactics</p>
            <p>AT= Assistive Technology or Access Technology</p>
            <p>Inclusive Design is an ideal approach for designing for universal access. To get it right, you need to incorporate real people in the design, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ensuring that everyone involved in the web projects understands the basics of how people with disabilities use the web</li>
              <li>involving users with disabilities early enough and throughout the design process</li>
              <li>involving users in evaluating web accessibility</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-2"><strong>Disability personas</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>what devices are they confortable with?</li>
              <li>how familiar are they with the domain, AT, device?, experiences, skills with the relevant tools and frequency of use</li>
              <li>do they have multiple disabilities?</li>
              <li>to what degree is the disability?, nature of the limitation</li>
              <li>we don't need so much info about demographichs (age, gender etc) but more about their pain points, behaviours and challenges</li>
              <li>they come from field studies</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-2"><strong>User Journey</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>identify user journey (key tasks / use cases / user stories</li>
              <li>apply your guidelines to them (tasks vs guidelines)</li>
              <li>simulations workshop is good, but pretending to have the disability is not the same as living with it</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-2">Accessibility needs to be built into Design and Dev from the start. Bake it in up front in 3 steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>build an Accessibility Program (at design phase, at dev phase and plan for post-launch support, maintenance and updating) work it into product management, UX design, code review and QA</li>
              <li>build a library of Accessible components and patterns</li>
              <li>build a library of accessibility Test Cases</li>
              <li>make Accessibility part of your vision and your process: design, dev, testing, deployment, support, modification to system</li>
              <li>develop a roadmap</li>
              <li>use the <a href="https://www.section508.gov/tools/playbooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT Accessiblity Playbook</a> - 12 rules developed byt the Access Board</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="assets/images/a11y/Technology Accessibility Playbook Version 1 (last updated 6_2_2016).doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Section 508 Playbook</strong></a></p>
            <p class="margin-top-2">Build the business case ROI</p>
            <ul>
              <li>SEO benefits</li>
              <li>increased Usability from accessibility</li>
              <li>remove Accessibility bug fixing time</li>
              <li>support for aging population 51% of US seniors are on broadband (speed of site, a bounce factor)</li>
              <li>reduce legal risk</li>
              <li>access to contracts (sell-ability)</li>
              <li>HTML5 efficiency / responsive web design</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-2">Team roles - all hands on</p>
            <ul>
              <li>product/program managers: integrate requests from the start, develop business case, track progress toward access goals</li>
              <li>UX Designers, UR - conduct field studies + testing + A'QA'</li>
              <li>developers - clean code (use ARIA), checkers, QA, ACC Code libraries</li>
              <li>QA team - build from start, unit testing, test against ACC user stories</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-2">Write user stories for accessibility, for example:<br>
            As a screen reader user who is blind<br>
            I WANT headings to be identified as actual headings<br>
            SO THAT I can navigate the web page by heading and understand the page's structure.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-2"><strong>Triangulated approach</strong>: use all the methods together: checkers, guidelines (WCAG), user access testing and retest user tool</p>

            <p class="lead">Meeting Accessibility Design</p>
            <p>Your <strong>visual bias</strong> is your biggest blocker:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>semantics:</strong> word, descriptions, confirmations, errors</li>
              <li><strong>interactions:</strong> animations micro-interactions</li>
              <li><strong>place:</strong> location on screen, movement, meaning from states (like hover on/off)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other bias:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>mouse heavy</strong> bias (requires mouse to use easily) - a lot of user only use their keyboard</li>
              <li><strong>colour only</strong> bias  (error message only in red text)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-2">Design phase, think of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>typography, colour contrast, link visibility and target size, label proximity</li>
              <li>and then look at: predictable and consistent navigation, visual focus indicator, blocks of content being separated and distinct from each other</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Design content by blocks</p>
            <ul>
              <li>organise content into blocks (grouping)</li>
              <li>identify the value/purpose of each block</li>
              <li>determine the best order for blocks to be read be screen reader</li>
              <li>large blocks will contain smaller block (define each + relationships)</li>
              <li>document block ordering (for visual design / coding later)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think accessible layout - determine the following focus points and movements:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the order in which elements receive focus</li>
              <li>the way in which elements are grouped</li>
              <li>where focus moves when the element in focus disappears</li>
              <li>clarify where the focus exists through a combination of visual indicators and accessibility text</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Prioritising content</p>
            <ul>
              <li>weigh by Persona need/priority</li>
              <li>identify your metadata (Headers, Headings, Images)</li>
              <li>push interruptible elements out of flow: widget (print, share, email etc) or eg cross-promotional stories or tools should not interrupt a story even if they appears in the body of the page</li>
              <li>structure the flow by context (not visual layout - but by how much sense it makes)</li>
              <li>develop a quick Accessibility "style guide" early (Blocks, Order, Flow rationale)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Design for focusability</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the ability to access essential UI elements without a mouse</li>
              <li>a layout schema for UX designers to map the content priorities on a page</li>
              <li>a navigation aid to allow smooth flow and reduce audio clutter or unnecessary screen reader overhead (or loopy navigation)</li>
              <li>CSS keyboard killer, never do: focus {outline:0;}</li>
              <li>good contrast</li>
              <li>complementary shape and size to the element</li>
              <li>colour scheme is complementary, but also stands out</li>
              <li>doesn't need to be the same for all elements</li>
              <li>animations help users track focus movement</li>
              <li>should degrade gracefully (be visible on older browser)</li>
              <li>should be the same across browsers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Focus design tips:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>list out focusable elements:</strong> How many variations of each do you have? If there are primary and secondary buttons that use different colours, will the same focus indicator work for both of them?</li>
              <li><strong>think about your colour scheme:</strong> Are you using a callout / highlight colour? Would that colour work well for focus? of not, is there a different colour that would?</li>
              <li><strong>mirror your hover states:</strong> in a lot of cases, a good focus state might be the same as the hover state. If your hover state is obvious, consider using that as a focus indication as well</li>
              <li><strong>custom style your focus:</strong> it's generally a good idea to replace the native browser focus style for all elements with a custom style so that focus indicators are consistent across browser</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">Website and Web application issues and tips</p>
            <ul>
              <li>assign active images first (CTA, verb/action labels, buttons vs links)</li>
              <li>then static images and decorative last</li>
              <li>classic no no: More..., clcik here, learn more, this, links to close to one another</li>
              <li>rule of thumb: if you're using a keyboard, anyhting you interact with should have a visible focus</li>
              <li>if using a coloured background, choose one which is single, solid colour, rather than texture or patterned</li>
              <li>the colour of your background does not matter as much as the contrast between the background and the text</li>
              <li>make sure your chosen colour scheme may be over-ridden by the browser settings if necessary</li>
              <li>avoid italic text as this can appear 'wobbly' on screen</li>
              <li>capitalisation of a sentence should be avoided</li>
              <li>primary things should be visible, secondary should be shown on hover - note that Hovers can be distracting for users with cognitive or mobility impairment</li>
              <li>small texts should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background</li>
              <li>large texts (at 14pt bold / 18pt regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (unless it's a decorative logo)</li>
              <li>label visual UI elements - this is a common mistake. Screen readers user need to know which UI elements are tappable on screen. To enable screen reader to read the name of components out loud, add the contentDescription attribute to components such as buttons, icons, and tabs containing icons that have no visible text</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-2">Mobile Accessibility Issues and Tips</p>
            <ul>
              <li>same as for desktop: labelling UI, grouping content, creating easy-to-follow navigation, using adequate colour contrast, using cues other than colours </li>
              <li>making touch target large (44-48px)</li>
              <li>presenting media content (control, toggle, subtitles or alt format)</li>
              <li>support large font on apps: iOS use built in Zoom & magnifier feature, on android the font size and font display size only work on Android 7 and up</li>
              <li>bluetooth keyboard issues: some devices have no physical keyboard, and no easy way to pair one </li>
              <li>infinte scrolling: furstrating for keyboard users - don't implement it</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Inclusive design is a methodology that is about valuing a diversity of experiences and abilities in the development of a product as well as in its future use. Designers should recognize that when accessibility issues are an add-on after the product has been developed, it is actually too late.</p>
            <p>Reframing the definition of disability from a health condition or personal attribute to, “a mismatch between the needs of an individual and a product, service, social structure, culture, or environment is huge because we all experience these mismatches on a day-to-day level whether they’re permanent, temporary or situational.</p>

            <p><strong>Inclusive design methods are a great addition to human-centered design methodologies. </strong></p>
            <p>Learning how people adapt to the world around them means spending time understanding their experience from their perspective.<br>
            When done well, we can recognise more than just the barriers that people encounter. We also recognise the motivations that all people have in common.</p>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Designing for accessibility is not that hard</strong></a></p>
            <p>Digital accessibility refers to the practice of building digital content and applications that can be used by a wide range of people, including individuals who have visual, motor, auditory, speech, or cognitive disabilities.</p>
            <p>There is a strong business case for accessibility: studies show that accessible websites have better search results, they reach a bigger audience, they’re SEO friendly, have faster download times, they encourage good coding practices, and they always have better usability.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>add enough colour contrast: </strong>According to the W3C, the contrast ratio between text and its background should be at least 4.5 to 1 (conformance level AA.) The ratios become more forgiving with larger and heavier fonts since they’re easier to read at lower contrast. If your type is at least 18 pt or 14 pt bold, the minimum contrast ratio drops to 3 to 1</li>
                <li><strong>don’t use colour alone to make critical information understandable: </strong>Try to use an indicator other than color such as text labels or patterns. When showing errors on the screen, don’t rely on colored text alone, add an icon or include a title to the message. Consider adding a visual cue such as font weight or underline text style to linked text in a paragraph, so the links stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>have clear focus indicators : </strong>People with visual and motoric disabilities should be able to navigate without a mouse or trackpad. Created focus indicators that are straight forward and obvious for all so that regardless of your level of ability, you can use a website or apps with clarity.</li>
                <li><strong>use labels or instructions with form fields and inputs: </strong>Always help people understand what they should do and write in a form. It’s best if labels don’t go away, even when the person is filling an input; people should never lose context with what they’re writing. People who use screen readers usually navigate through a form using the Tab key to jump through the form controls. The &lt;label&gt; elements are read for each form control. Any non-label text, as placeholder text, is usually skipped over.</li>
                <li><strong>write useful <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>alternative text</strong></a> for your images and other non-text content: </strong>Try to describe what’s happening in the image, and how it matters to the story, rather than just saying something like “picture,” context is everything.<br>
                    If the image is purely decorative or if it creates redundancy because the surrounding context already explains the content. Then adding an empty <alt> attribute will make screen readers skip it. If you don’t write any alt text, some screen readers will read the file name to the individual. If the image is functional like a printer icon, then give the alt attribute the value of the action that will happen "print", also check <a href="https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Axess Lab guidance about alt text</strong></a></li>
                <li><strong>use correct markup on your content: </strong>Headings mark where the content starts — they’re tags given to text to define its style and purpose. Headings also establish the hierarchy of the content of the page.<br>
                    Titles with big font sizes help a reader understand the order of the content better. Likewise, screen readers also use heading tags to read content. This way, people with low-vision get an overview of the page by reading each heading in a hierarchal flow.<br>
                    It’s important to use proper structural elements when you develop a site. HTML elements communicate to the browser what kind of content they contain and how the browser should render or treat that content. The components and structure of a page are what arranges an accessibility tree. This tree is what powers screen readers which are used by people who are blind so they can “listen” to a page.</li>
                <li><strong>use strong typographic hierarchy: </strong>good typography is the key to good design. Ensure that typographic hierarchy makes sense without the use of too many different of shades of grays. Rely on strong type sizing and bolding to create a meaningful hierarchy so that information makes sense at a glance. Enabled support for dynamic font sizes. This way you can use the default accessibility feature to change the size of the text to what suits you best.</li>
               <li><strong>support keyboard navigation: </strong>Keyboard accessibility is one of the most critical aspects of web accessibility. People with motor disabilities, blind people that rely on screen readers, people that don’t have precise muscle control, and even power users are dependent on a keyboard to navigate content.<br>
                The focus state that we discussed before provides a visual indicator of the component that is currently selected.<br>
                As you navigate through a page, the order of the interactive elements is essential, and the navigation must be logical and intuitive. The tab order should follow the visual flow of the page: left to right, top to bottom — header, main navigation, content buttons and inputs, and finally the footer.<br>
                Be careful with the size of your navigation — this includes the number of links and the length of the text. Tabbing through long menus may be demanding for people with motor disabilities. And listening to lengthy links can be cumbersome for people that use screen readers—try to be concise. Providing ARIA landmarks or HTML5 structural elements like &lt;main&gt; or &lt;nav&gt; will make navigation easier. </li>
                <li><strong>use SVGs: </strong>Replace PNGs with SVGs so that icons and UI components render clear and sharp when you use the built-in zooming feature that’s available on most operating systems and browsers. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>These guidelines will help you make your web design get closer to meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. There are 3 levels A is the lowest, AAA is the higest. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More info about level of conformance here.</a></p>
            
            <p class="lead">The developing approach to service building at GOV.UK</p>
            <p> The assisted digital team found that usually we default to and encourage service builders to segment users in a way that blocks inclusive service building:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>digital user: </strong>can use an online service independently</li>
              <li><strong>assisted digital users: </strong>can’t and receive help offline to do things online</li>
              <li><strong>non-digital, non-user: </strong>can’t and use a separate, offline way to do things</li>
              <li><strong>accessibility-related user: </strong>with disabilities or impairments</li>
            </ul>
           <p><strong>There is also a segmentation by channel:</strong></p>
           <p>There are useful things to know when delivering services over specific channels, for example how to handle data securely online. But channels are just the medium between government and citizens, often chosen as a symptom of other factors, for example picking up the phone because a website crashes, or going to a local Citizens Advice because you couldn’t understand what was being said over the phone.<br>
              The channel is not the user, and we found that segmenting users by the channel they’re using <strong>leads to exclusive design</strong>. For example, digital service builders work hard to ensure online content is comprehensible and measurable, but much less hard, or not at all, to make telephone content the same.<br>
              Designers do the hardest work to make online stuff simple. Yet the greatest needs and highest costs are around offline interactions.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Inclusive segments for inclusive service building:</strong></p>
            <p>We reviewed the reasons why users of all characteristics, on all channels might struggle or fail to successfully use a service, and found that all of us, all users, share areas of limited capacity:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>time available</li>
              <li>financial situation</li>
              <li>ease of physically access to an interface (including a person)</li>
              <li>interface capability</li>
              <li>awareness of the service and access options</li>
              <li>ability to comprehend information</li>
              <li>mental health / emotional capacity</li>
              <li>trust in service robustness, security, reliability</li>
              <li>ability to provide required information</li>
              <li>self-confidence to be able to do what’s required of them</li>
              <li>willingness to use the service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We think that approaching guidance around these universally applicable areas will better encourage and enable service builders to build services that are inclusive and work properly for all.</p>

            <p>From the google accessibility group - Veronika Jermolina :</p>
            <p>
              I tested Recite Me toolbar with users with diverse needs in the past (including dyslexia, vision and motor impairments). The overall recommendation to the client was not to use it as it took control away from users, while not adding any benefits. This was despite us recognising that the intention behind the toolbar was to help as many users as possible. <br>
              From memory:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Participants didn’t think / know to enable the toolbar as they didn’t see the label or didn't think it applied to them. Participants also didn’t know how to exit the tool once enabled and felt lack of control</li>
              <li>Participants didn’t know what to expect before clicking / activating a button as icons didn’t make sense (both visually and to screen reader users)</li>
              <li>The resulting change to the page sometimes made the experience worse (e.g. colour contrast combinations, loss of visual effects like button borders…)</li>
              <li>There were issues around keyboard access, including enabling the toolbar</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Note that Recite Me may have made changes since I tested it about 2 years ago.<br>
              My experience is that people with access needs require technologies to help them access all information, not just on one website. Saying that, solutions like Recite Me could work in some instances where users with diverse needs require regular access to a website.

            <p>Once an assistive technology user can find a rhythm that works for them, they tend to stick to it. For Dragon users this often means <strong>dictating their speech into a single long Word document</strong>, where it is easy to see and edit, and then transferring it into the various dialogue boxes in their web browser.</p>
            <p>For JAWS users a dossier of case material prepared and saved into PDF was far easier to read than piecemeal material in various formats under a host of different tabs.</p>
            <p>Try to make any content – including lists of options – <strong>as concise as possible </strong>so that it can be quickly understood.</p>
            <p>No one reads every word on every page. We’re looking for the gist. Screen reader users are no different. In fact experienced <strong>users often like to speed up the reading rate to 300 words per minute</strong> or more. This is their equivalent of scanning the page.</p>
            <p>Lots of lines and global navigation create tedium and should allow for easy skipping, ideally in one go, for example with the <strong>‘Skip Navigation’</strong> link.</p>
            <p><strong>Links need to go somewhere</strong><br>
              It sounds obvious, but with widgets and compartmentalised page content, clicking a link will often update just a section of the page. This is great for sighted users who will spot such a difference. But not for a screen reader user.<br>
              There are ways to avoid this issue. You <strong>could ensure that the new content is announced by the screen reader by using ARIA live regions or by moving focus to the updated content.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Designers and developers should implement the solution that provides the best user experience. This will depend on the particular design, content and functionality of the page.<br>
                  <strong>Offer a linear and obvious layout</strong><br>
                  One of the screens we tested had been designed full of embedded, progressive logic. Each time a user answered a question, yet another nested level of questions appeared, depending on how they’d answered the previous question.  3 levels in our screen reader users had no idea which question they were answering anymore.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Include integration with other software such as Word and Adobe Acrobat</strong><br>
                  Even if your system is web-based, if you are relying on other software, such as <strong> Word or PDF</strong>, for downloading or viewing material, you must include this in your testing.<br>
                  In our testing, every Dragon user’s Word software crashed when they tried to download documents. With screen readers, pop-up dialogues to save/open docs in Word were ignored, leaving them stranded.
              </p>
              <p>Problems experienced by assistive technology users are often also experienced by all users<br>
                  When we tested with assistive technology users, we found them struggling with overly complex screens, missing key pieces of information and struggling to download and open documents.<br>
                  We found exactly the same thing when we tested with people who weren’t using assistive technology. <br>

              <p>
                  <strong>Markup:</strong><br>
                  HTML is a type of markup. A markup is basically a text with notes and rules - indentation, bold (or emphasis), title, quotations, etc.<br>
                  CSS is a list of styles. It tells the browser the font, font-size, spacing, colours, etc.<br>       
                  For those used to Microsoft Word, the concept of style is not too foreign. It’s just a set of rules that define the layout of the document.<br>
                  A PDF - when it has text inside - uses a form of markup very similar to HTML called XML. And it uses styles too, although in a way that’s less effective for humans to edit and more effective to maintain every single detail exactly the same, regardless of resolution/size etc…<br>                  
                  The reason PDF prints what you see in the screen is because what you see in the screen is a digital form of how it’s going to look on paper. It’s build for paper.<br>                   
                  PDF, although being a digital file, is NOT suitable for what some of us call Digital (digital transformation, etc..) Because mainly it is like paper but online.<br>                   
                  HTML and CSS can do many many things, like animations for example. But the main thing it tries to be is a legible and flexible text document. Flexible as in it should work not matter how you tried to use it. One can read a HTML in a smartwatch or in a big digital billboard (Piccadilly Circus/Shibuya/Times Square style). PDFs not so much.<br>                   
                  HTML and CSS share the responsibilities of making a document accessible.<br>                   
                  CSS, for example, will define font size and its proportions (line-height, spacing, etc). Also colours and contrast, all very important for accessibility. HTML helps screen readers, navigation, tips for images and descriptions. Content-wise HTML rules. In terms of how it looks, CSS is the king.<br> <br>                  
                  <strong>Looking the same on paper as it does on a screen:</strong><br>                   
                  If one wants a HTML+CSS combo with very strict rules that will make whatever is on the screen to be transposed exactly the same when printed, that is possible. But that is possibly an under-utilisation of its flexibility.<br>
                  I’d suggest that if it need to look in a particular way when printed, that this design would be translated to CSS with the tag @media print. This way, when printed the document should look exactly like this particular layout. In parallel to this tag and its rules, the design could have a more flexible set of rules for the screen with the tag @media screen - making it accessible and visible in any device.<br><br>

            <p>Switch Access Scanning is a way of interacting with a computer that requires considerable concentration and physical control. However, those individuals who have certain physical disabilities and dexterity difficulties may depend on this input method.<br>
              Switch access scanning tends to be used by those who are not able to operate a touch screen in the traditional way, but are still able to operate a mobile device.<br>
              People can use gestures, like the turning of the head, or a hardware bluetooth switch that they can press or even the whole touchscreen can act as a single switch.<br>
              The focus of the application moves automatically from one element of the user interface to the next element. When the user wants to perform an action on the element, the switch is pressed and the action is performed.

            <p>Type of testing</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>usability testing</strong>: Think Aloud, task based, any device, any location, open discovery of issues</li>
              <li><strong>accessibility testing</strong>: Think Aloud, Assistive Tech (user's device and configurations) Chair's side quite often in their home; open discovery of issues</li>
              <li><strong>code level testing</strong>: testing for code efficiency, errors, guidelines; code de-bugging</li>
              <li><strong>QA/ User Acceptance testing</strong>: testing for what has been designed vs what users need</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users often have a comfort zone within their own settings for assistive technologies, that's why it's important to use their own devices when testing. It's critical as not doing this will affects your results.</p>

            <p>For accessibility testing, you follow the same best practice as for usability testing (think aloud, gather metrics, success rate, time on task, errors/ confusions, subjective satisfaction) but also <strong>read everything out loud for the users</strong>: tasks, subjective satisfaction questionnaire</p>
            
            <p class="lead">A.T. by disability type:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>blind</strong>: screen readers, keyboard</li>
              <li><strong>mobility</strong>: speech input, alternative input device (head pointer, single switch device, motion tracking), keyboard</li>
              <li><strong>cognitive</strong>: none</li>
              <li><strong>Deaf + HOH</strong>: closed captioning, speech input</li>
              <li><strong>low vision</strong>: magnifiers, keyboard</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="lead">What to include in accesibility testing scope:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>test for keyboard accessibility</li>
              <li>tab focusability and tab order</li>
              <li>keyboard functionality</li>
              <li>keyboard functionality with screen reader</li>
              <li>make sure you can tab through, go back and move with arrow keys</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You also need to be ready, have Braille format if needed, or a sign language interpreter, a friend or family for example. </p>
            <p><strong>Formative testing</strong>: form your decisions. Goal is to understand issues and problem areas to fix. Use to fix code and to conduct accessible QA.</p>
            <p><strong>Summative testing</strong>: sums up metrics. Goal is to gather metrics and understand user performance against task success (eg compared to a control group eg users without disabilities). Use to certify compliance or to tease of 3rd party software accessibility.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-2">A major difference with usability testing is because of the poor state of accessibility, users can not always verify or troubleshoot like a user without disabilities. This can lead to accidental skipping or a task or UI element you are trying to have the user evaluate. This means more delicate moderation is needed. "Can you check that last thing again?", "Can you try that one more time for me?". also, things move more quickly and intensely during an accessibility Test, that YOU might be overwhelmed and miss an observation! Use your discretion if conducting summative tests (so you do not bias your data). Good moderation technique is important, as with usability testing.</p>

            <p><strong>The Principles of Universal Design</strong> is a foundation for designers who set out to create Universal Design products. The principles were created to guide a wide range of design disciplines including environments, products, and communications. You can apply these principles to any design style or trend; they are timeless and adaptable. You will be proactively taking on accessibility by incorporating these principles at the beginning of a project.</p>
            <p>There are seven principles, and they all include guidelines with actionable approaches for Universal Design. Each principle captures a key concept. Whenever you are using the guidelines to plan and evaluate your design, an important thing to note is that sometimes only a few of the seven principles will be relevant to your current design. In the following section, you'll learn about each of the seven principles and its guidelines. Additionally, we will look at design examples for each principle so you can apply these immediately to your projects.</p>

            <p>From the google group. How to tell a screen reader user that a page is taking a while to update?<br>
              Using an aria-live region, containing an appropriate message ? <br>
              If we have an aria-live region containing a message e.g. "We are updating the search results. Please do not refresh the page." then we presumably need a similar message to tell them when this process is complete.<br>
              What happens in the case of the results being refreshed so quickly that the two messages are too close together? it could be awkward and not optimised for the user listening.
            </p>
            <p>using aria-live=”polite” for the loading messages and aria-live=”assertive” for the completion message could work.</p>
