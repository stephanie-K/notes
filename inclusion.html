          <p>From <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/a-beginners-guide-to-inclusive-ux-design-b8dcc94f5068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A beginner’s guide to inclusive UX design by Trina Moore Pervall</a>:</p>
          <p><strong>Accessible UX design</strong> minimizes barriers so that content and features can be accessed and used regardless of one’s permanent, situational or temporary disabilities in the areas: hearing, motor, vision, speech, and cognition. Since disability is only one aspect of identity, accessibility is one aspect of inclusive design.</p>
          <p><strong>Inclusive UX design</strong> minimizes alienating any product-relevant social identity: disability, race/ethnicity, gender, skin color, age, size, sexual orientation, language, etc.</p>
          <p>When talking exclusively about accessibility, call it accessible design, not inclusive design. A product can be accessible and still alienate other product-relevant identities making the product ableist, mysogynistic, racist, heteronormative, cisnormative, xenophobic, ageist, body shaming, skin-tone biased, etc. Inclusive design is intersectional, a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw.</p>

              <li>Cognitive biases are shortcuts the brain takes to make decisions. 95% of cognition is subconscious. Next time someone asks you why you're doing something, the most honest answer you can give is "how the hell should I know?"</li>
              <li>Cognitive fluency is a thing. Clarity is king in product content strategy: Easy to read = easy to do, Hard to read = hard to do </li>
              <li>Our own biases can be the biggest danger to users. Watch out for déformation professionnelle, the tendency to view the world through the eyes of our own profession. And the bias blind spot – we all have cognitive biases</li>
              <li>The best way to recognise and overcome bias is to question our assumptions in a systematic way. And get really good at listening, because it's impossible to listen and react at the same time</li>
          </ul>

            <p>It's often the same thing for SD and A11Y for example'.</p>
            <p>Some examples from Service Week panel discussion: Building Service Design buy in and capability (<a href="https://twitter.com/StephanieKrus/status/1367811963561119745?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link to Thread</a>):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get senior people interested and keen to support by showing how the approach works in a service redesign or project</li>
                <li>Build a community of people across services who are keen to work in this way and work in the open with them</li>
                <li>Build the approach into data to day business by ensuring it is included in service reviews, project guidance & improvement work, using #SAtSD maturity model <a href="https://gov.scot/publications/the-scottish-approach-to-service-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAtSD webpage</a> and refer to <a href="https://audit-scotland.gov.uk/report/digital-progress-in-local-government (page 16)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audit Scotland report</a>.</li>
                <li>Find a champion who has a louder voice than you and ask them to use it</li>
                <li>Let your work speak for you, sometimes telling people you used SD approaches AFTER the fact can be more powerful</li>
                <li>Get promoting, socials, case studies, blogs</li>

            <p>From this video (43 minutes in), some advice for their champions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Find out who is interested (any level of scale - everyone welcome)</li>
                <li>Be the voices of the users, not just yours</li>
                <li>Training first</li>
                <li>Provide the guidance in a form that is easy to use</li>
                <li>Find the right communication channels for them</li>
                <li>Talk to your champions</li>

            <p>Quite often people don’t know what to do or how to do it well. We could provide guidelines, things to consider, tips, common pitfalls, have a wiki as a source of knowledge. </p>
            <p>We need volunteers, and encourage them (they should not be ‘volunteered’). We need to support them and train them initially.</p>

             <li>You’re not able to meaningfully share power</li>

             <li>You have tight timelines</li>
             <li>You can’t compensate people fairly for their time</li>
             <li>It could directly or indirectly harm them</li>
             <li>Users don’t actually care that much about this

D. Sean</strong></a> or as <a href="assets/images/sd/Abolish-the-Cop-Insider-Your-Designer-Head.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PDF</a></p>
    <p>Some highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>policing targets non-criminal behavior (drinking in public) and low-level crimes ("graffiti, public urination, panhandling, littering, and unlicensed street vending") in public spaces. Policing criminalizes individuals for simply existing, or being poor, inpublic</li>
        <li>Research shows that even the act of reading all of the privacy policies to which one is exposed online would take the average adult 76 working days per year,market. As Sarah T. Hamid put it, privacy is "less like a design value, and more like a luxury demand”</li>
        <li>Designers have been taught that they can perform acts of empathy, such as suggesting that a designer can learn about the disabled experience by walking around blindfolded or on crutches, instead of centering the lived experiences of people with disabilities. The concept of empathy has been bastardized so much that rarely do designers actually willfully surrender power in order to be empathetic.</li>
        <li>The mental models of design continue to privilege white, Western, European, post-colonial, post-imperialist frameworks, norms, and cultural expressions. 
            This led some to posit that design and design thinking protect white supremacy by perpetuating characteristics of white supremacy culture. 
            These characteristics include perfectionism, a sense of urgency, defensiveness, valuing quantity over quality, worship of the written word, belief in only one right way, paternalism,
            either/or thinking, power hoarding, fear of open conflict, individualism, belief that "I'm the only one who can do this right,"
            belief that progress is bigger and more, belief in objectivity, and claiming a right to comfort. Others have extended this analysis and argued that design thinking and its modernist roots are merely a rebrand for white supremacy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s also important to understand what it means to be in service of a community, and by extension to the team members who are from that community. When I'm leading a team working in a community that isn’t mine, non-hierarchical leadership means enabling team members to nurture and hold onto relationships way after I'm gone. This can look like doing childcare, coordinating transportation vouchers, taking notes, or doing whatever it takes to create the space and skill-sets for other people to do the literal work of community building.</p>
    <p>This is tied to how many thinkers—mainly Indigenous people—are challenging how epistemology needs to have a Western foundation, or otherwise it’s not valid. International development as a whole has a deeply rooted history in imperialism and neo-colonial practices. It's this idea that you bring in expertise from Anglo-Saxon and Euro-centric centers of knowledge that you then take to other communities. Then you “support” or “help” them. It’s paternalistic, patronizing, and transactional.</p>
    <p>We were drafting our language around seeking informed consent. The translator was using a proverb: “You cannot force a dog to run.” This proverb explains how you can't force someone to do something, and that's how they explained the idea of informed consent to someone.</p>
    <p>This was also a community that has a huge presence of international development actors, so a lot of people experienced research fatigue. They're asked to participate in projects all the time. And so they often said, "Why are you talking to me? Just go talk to the healthcare worker," or whoever. So there was a proverb that we used to explain why we wanted to do more participatory research approaches. It was something along the lines of “Whoever lives in the house is the only one who knows where the water leaks.” We could tap into the power of a phrase that just in one sentence communicates so much more than what I could have done in a few dry and unfamiliar paragraphs.</p>
    <p>There's not a single project where I felt any smarter or any more insightful than any single person that I've engaged with. That's not only not true, but it also stems from a hierarchical way of categorizing relationships which is devaluing of participants’ own knowledge and expertise.</p>
    <p>I think working in the social sector forces you to be a lot more reflective about your positionality, your biases, and the privilege that you bring into your work. It just pushes you to not rely on what you've learned at school as the end all be all of what you need to know.</p>
    <p>Adrienne Maree Brown has this wonderful quote in Emergent Strategy that says, "Move at the speed of trust." And working in the social sector relies on building trust, building relationships, and creating the space for what it means to seek mutual liberation. You can't do that in a short amount of time. You can't do that in the pace that typical design or design research engagements are done in the private sector.</p>
    <p>When I work in the social sector, I try to come in as a whole person that doesn't have this artificial separation. I come in with my full immigrant, my queer, my feminist, my person of color selves into the work.</p>
    <p>There’s the Maya Angelou quote that goes, "Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better." Except it's not a destination, it’s a journey. I'm continually being like, "Well, the way that I was used to doing this thing, I can't do that anymore." Even the other day, I learned to challenge the fact that maybe inclusion isn't the point because the people who are doing the “including” are still upholding deeply asymmetric power dynamics by holding the privilege to set the terms for what inclusivity means.</p>

    <blockquote>Power: an actor’s ability to influence an outcome. This is affected by asymmetry in relationships. Power can be used both positively and negatively. - Maya Goodwill – from their power literacy guide</blockquote>
    <p>Maya develops 5 forms of power:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Privilege</strong>: power you get from a social relation where you benefit due to the social group you belong to, at the expense of another social group. It is an unearned advantage given to you because of your identity.
      It is possible to both have privilege and experience oppression at the same time, since identity is intersectional. When you have privilege, it is often invisible to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Access power</strong>: ability to influence who is included in and who is excluded from the design project and process</li>
    <li><strong>Goal power</strong>: ability to initiate the design project to begin with, as well as the ability to influence decisions related to framing the problem, defining desired outcomes and structuring the design process</li>
    <li><strong>Role power</strong>: ability to influence the roles that different stakeholders take on. This includes the ability to assign any roles or titles in the design process (eg. ‘participant’, ‘co-designer’, or ‘user’), as well as influencing the role each stakeholder plays in making decisions, especially who is given the ability to analyze
      and prioritize findings in the converging phases</li>
    <li><strong>Rule power</strong>: ability to influence the way you will work together. This includes what is considered ‘normal,’ what is and isn’t allowed, the language being used, and beliefs about what types of knowledge and ways of doing are valid in the design process</li>
  </ul>
    <p>More definitions from their glossary:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Privilege</strong>: a social relation where one social group benefits at the expense of another. It is an unearned advantage and is often invisible to those who have it</li>
      <li><strong>Oppression</strong>: the systematic and pervasive inequality embedded within social institutions, interpersonal interactions and individual consciousness. It can be understood as the inverse of privilege, or the 'isms' (racism, ableism, sexism, classism etc...)</li>
      <li><strong>Stakeholder</strong>: an individual, social group or organisation that will be impacted in some way by the design project, process and/or it's outcomes. The impact might be large, small, positive, or negative</li>
      <li><strong>Marginalised</strong>: a group or category of people made to be less important or of lower status, typically less decision-making ability and influence</li>
      <li><strong>Democracy</strong>: the idea that everyone shuld have an equal say in making decision that impact them</li>
      <li><strong>Social justice</strong>: equitable treament, opportunities, rights and distribution of resources within and between all communities and social groups in a dignified and respectful way</li>
      <li><strong>Design</strong>: the intention and the untinentional impact behind an outcome (definition from Creative reaction Lab's Equity-centred Community Design Field guide)</li>
      <li><strong>Participatory design</strong>: the involvement of various stakeholders in the design process. Participation exists along a spectrum</li>
      <li><strong>Power literacy</strong>: the ability to practice self-awareness of, be sensitive to and understand the impact of power in order to align outcomes to intentions</li>
      <li><strong>Reflexivity</strong>: an actor's awareness of power and the corresponding social structures internalised by themselves and other around them</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ten ethical questions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is design’s relationship to power and privilege?</li>
      <li>Which humans do we center when we say, “Human-Centered Design”?</li>
      <li>How can designers say no to work when we need to pay off _______?</li>
      <li>Design is often sink or swim: why is drowning even an option?</li>
      <li>How do designers decide which people-in-need to serve?</li>
      <li>How do we wean design’s addiction from whiteness?</li>
      <li>Why do designers prefer to help people in another country, before helping people in their own backyard?</li>
      <li>Why does philanthropy, not community, set the agenda for social change?</li>
      <li>What’s the cost of speaking up? And what’s the cost if we don’t?</li>
      <li>What right do I have to do this work?</li>

            <p>Simon Croft, Director of Professional and Educational Services says: “At GI, we’re often asked for top tips for the workplace. Every organisation is different, but there are common themes that can help every setting increase its inclusivity.“</p>
            <p>Mind Your Language!</p>
            <p>Language is a central part of everyday interactions, and gender features frequently. Everything from names, pronouns and titles, to terms for identities, partners and relationships can all be gendered.</p>
            <p>Using the right language demonstrates thoughtfulness and respect, but if we guess or assume, we’ll get it wrong some of the time. So establish a culture where people don’t assume what language to use about other people, but ask instead.</p>
            <p>Set clear protocols such as ‘Start with gender neutral language’, ‘Ask, listen, respect’, and ‘If you make a mistake, apologise briefly and move on’.</p>
            <p><strong>We don’t guess people’s names – we ask and then do our best to remember. It’s simply an extension of that.</strong></p>

            <p>About using womxn: Hi! Please stop using “womxn” to be “inclusive” of trans women. It makes us feel unwelcome, by implying we’re not “women” and you need to make up a new word to include us and cis women.
              There’s a perfectly good word that includes trans and cis women.

            <ul>
              <li>do you want to ask your research question about sex, or about gender, or about something else entirely? The best advice I can give is this: be specific</li>
              <li>If you’re asking questions about uterine health, ask if your participant has a uterus, not for their gender </li>
                <li>If you’re researching gender bias, ask about gender</li>
                <li>If you simply need sex statistics, ask about sex</li>
                <li>Think critically about what information you want</li>
                <li>sex and gender are not the same</li>
                <li>Sex describes a set of physical characteristics that are often associated with binary gender</li>
                <li>Gender describes an individuals’ personal gender identity</li>
                <li>Make sure you do not mix these up or conflate them!</li>
                <li>One of the most common mistakes I see in this is listing “male” and “female” (and sometimes “intersex”) as genders. None of these are genders, all three of them are sex descriptors, and should only be used if you are asking a question about sex specifically</li>
                <li>transgender is an adjective, not a noun or a verb. This means it can only be applied as an adjective, so a person can be transgender, but a person cannot be *a* transgender</li>
                <li>it is transphobic to list “women”, “men”, “trans women” and “trans men”, when we say #TransWomenareWomen and #TransMenareMen we mean that creating a separate category for trans people is othering and exclusive. “Separate but equal” doesn’t work</li>
              </ul>

                <p>Here’s the simplest possible options that I would recommend, when asking questions about sex and gender: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>For sex, list options: male, female and intersex</li>
                  <li>For gender, list options: man, woman, nonbinary (write in)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And if you want to know if participants are trans? Ask that as a separate question, just as you would ask about any other adjective.  You can simply ask “are you transgender”</p>
                <p>More options for diversity are always best, but the above framework is the simplest possible framework.</p>
                <p>In general, sex when applied to humans is NOT a particularly helpful categorization. Overall, it’s best practice to avoid asking about sex (instead ask specific anatomy or physiology questions) altogether if possible.</p>

            <p>Inclusivity is not a bolt on (34min) you need to plan in every aspect (For example: fire safety, how can a blind person exit safely - what's the plan? even if you don't have a blind employee yet)</p>
            <p>Do you have a process for a member of staff transitioning?</p>
            <p>Have a conversation with your employees without being nosy: what do you need? what do you have at the moment? is this enough? what might you need? how do you link to communication? what works for you? Get to know your staff better, but leave the private, private.</p>

            <p>For example: I'm an advocate, and an ally, but not a representative nor an expert. I recognise my priviledge as an educated white woman, living in a place that has provided me with lots of opportunities</p>
            <p>We are not epxerts, we are inherently biased. Nothing we will say today is new or original (will source citations etc) Our beliefs are socially situed, so this mayb not apply to everyone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Document how tools may exclude or include oppressed communications. Provide options not accommodations. Use multiple methods and compare findings, that is methods triangulation.</p>

            <p>the system is also the problem: Inlcusion as identity capitalism. The exploitation of diversity to maintain inequality. The organisations go for that classic black best friend by hiring favoravle participants to claim to be inclusive, dust their hands off and then do the bare minimum of 'include until profitable' as Josh Halstead puts it.</p>

            <p>Tyler Gindraux about doing workshop with BSL speaker:</p>
            <p> I'd hire interpreters – usually 2 per hour, which meant the interpreters had breaks every 15 minutes and switching helps with participants' cognitive load.
              <br>I'd share a detailed 'guide' ahead of time the activities, participants (how many attendees will use sign language), the 'why' or goal of the workshop, etc.
              <br>Then ideally I'd meet the interpreters ahead of time (even 10 mins before helps, if that's all you & they can manage).
              <br>During the workshop I'll facilitate and work in 'chunks' – so I'll run through how an activity works, then that's interpreted, and continue.
              <br>Interpreters often switch between themselves, so I'd just pay attention to when they are ready to switch and then pause while they do. 
              <br>I think the key is to let the interpreters communicate to you when something is 'wrong' – it's unclear, you're going quickly, someone has a question and you missed it, they can't see the slides and therefore can't translate them.
              <br>So build in extra time for all those moments.
              <br>Also you mentioned having an interpreter or native speaker lead, which would be ideal especially if the group is all speaking that language.        
              <br>If you can find a facilitator who does that, that's even better. They'll pick up more & participants will likely feel more comfortable. 
              <br>And if you don't know a facilitator but have a colleague or someone interested in upskilling you could support them to learn how to facilitate.
              <br>In that case, I'd still hire an interpreter for your benefit, so you can observe the session and help where needed. 
            </p>
            <p>Other advice</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Share the material in advance with the translator</li>
              <li> I talked them left time for translator, we had lots of images and visual examples, plus activities where they worked in groups so not reliant on his talk</li>
                <li>My one tip is sift for jargon that doesn’t translate well</li>
                <li>In-person, in English first, followed by translator. Also you could have any process instructions on a slide or flip chart in first language, although trickier if more then one language. And/or handouts in preferred/first language too.
                  What this all does is adds to your design and preparation time of course.
                  Super important to have proper briefings with interpreters as well!</li>

            <p>
              From Nick Bowmast: When working in markets where English isn’t commonly spoken I use simultaneous translation, so my client and I listen in English to a conversation in the local language. Translation is a skill I have respect for, and it’s indispensable for in-market customer insight work.
<br><br>
                While a well-briefed bilingual interviewer talks with research participants in their local language, the translator relays the conversation in English through a mic and earbuds, delivering aural goodness on about a three second delay. This sounds disconnected, but on reflection from a recent study in Japan I'm beginning to feel this can be even better than a conversation in my own language... Kinda like firewood.
<br><br>
                As a pile of firewood warms you twice – once when you chop it, then again when you burn it – seeing and hearing the mannerisms, accent, tone and gestures, then hearing it in your own language a few seconds later ... allows a time buffer to process what I’m seeing and hearing, first as an emotional response, followed closely behind by the cognitive. Even with a highly-skilled translator it takes a few minutes to get used to, but in time the nuances and meaning are flowing.
<br><br>
                At times my client or myself will ask questions via the translator, but hearing a dialogue between two people is much more natural, so the way most of an interview plays out. Like sitting around a warm fire. Mmmm.

    <p>We understand the difference between trauma informedness and trauma responsiveness as the difference between principles and practices. As Rachael Dietkus puts it, whereas trauma-informed researchers would acknowledge the existence of trauma, trauma-responsive researchers “actively anticipate the potential existence of trauma” and address it throughout the research process</p>
    <p>So as not to overwhelm the participants, all communications are held by the same team member</p>
    <p>Before: Helped the participant understand what to expect, describing what the research session will look like, who will be there, how long it will last, how much they will be compensated, how their data will be used, and other information to help minimize the “unknown” and the anxiety it might induce. We also sent them the interview questions in advance and specified that they didn’t need to prepare anything before coming to the session </p>
    <p>Set a protocol in place for identifying and responding to signs of distress from participants: To help researchers identify and respond effectively to symptoms of distress, we also conducted a training for team members to be able to recognize affect changes in participants, and established a 5-step protocol for what to do when participants are distressed or uncomfortable:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Track and notice</li>
      <li>Acknowledge and validate</li>
      <li>Offer options for support</li>
      <li>Follow their lead</li>
      <li>Check in again before ending the session</li>
    </ol>
    <p>During research interactions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide opportunities for refusal</li>
      <li>Practice active and attentive listening</li>
      <li>Avoid asking participants to recall memories in sequential ways</li>
      <li>Watch for signs of distress and respond accordingly</li>
      <li>Acknowledge needs participants are expressing</li>
      <li>End research interactions on a caring note</li>
      <li>Support the research team as they experience vicarious trauma</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After: Assure participants that we are committed to the accuracy of their experience: Another thing that can be traumatizing for participants is feeling like their words have been taken out of context. After synthesizing the data and writing the research findings, we plan a process inviting study participants who agreed to be followed up with to correct, nuance, and react to our draft report and make sure that the interpretation of that data aligns with the intent the research participant had in mind.</p>

    <p>Think about your own interactions with the people you have contact with, as well as their experience as they walk through your organisation or service</p>
    <p>Where and how do you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>currently recognise the impact of trauma on people, and how do you adapt how you respond?</li>
  <li>think you offer people a sense of safety, work collaboratively, offer choice over what happens, gain their trust, empower them, and recognise and support their resilience?</li>
  <li>think people are offered consistency, security and safety, and feel able to trust you, the staff and the organisation? </li>
</ul>

<p>What do you commit to doing to sustain your current work with people that:</p>
  <li>recognises the impact of trauma on people</li>
  <li>creates a sense of safety, choice collaboration control, empowerment, and trust for everyone</li>

            <p>One take away is to go beyond only focussing about web accessibility and assisted digital support, and to look at the universal barriers:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>awareness </strong> for example: knowing there’s a phone line to call for help, knowing the service exists at all</li>
              <li><strong>enthusiasm </strong> for example: to try an online version of a paper form, to apply for help, to agree to a request, to go through an arduous process</li>
              <li><strong>access </strong> for example: to an office, a printer, a computer, a Citizens Advice bureau or a photo booth</li>
              <li><strong>time </strong> for example: to gather information, fill out forms, travel, spend time on the phone, wait for a response</li>
              <li><strong>finance </strong> for example: o risk a fine, to pay a fee, to get the bus, to use the phone, to use a printer, to be away from work, to risk other benefits</li>
              <li><strong>evidence </strong> for example: to provide bank statements, photo identification or character witness statements</li>
              <li><strong>interface / interaction capability </strong> for example: ability to talk face to face, computer skills, verbal ability, handwriting</li>
              <li><strong>comprehension </strong> for example: ability to understand spoken advice, signage at a venue, or written content</li>
              <li><strong>self confidence </strong> for example: belief in ability to understand a process, complete complex tasks or deal with uncertainty</li>
              <li><strong>emotional state </strong> for example: feeling psychologically strong enough to take on a task</li>
              <li><strong>trust </strong> for example: confident that the technology and people involved will be secure and reliable</li>
            </ol>
            <p>and that barriers don’t occur in isolation, they overlap and intersect.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Over-focusing on certain types leads to more exclusion</p>
            <p>There are many more barriers to inclusion than disability and digital capability</p>
            <p>Inclusivity takes more than web-accessibility and assisted digital support</p>
            <br>
            <p>3 key requirements for inclusive services</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>The will: </strong>People have to want to build things that will work for everyone who needs to use them</li>
              <li><strong>The scope: </strong>People have to be considering all the interactions users have, via all devices, channels, people and organisations</li>
              <li><strong>An inclusive way to think about exclusion: </strong> Government teams often focus on certain approaches to certain types of inclusion / exclusion</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Disability → web-accessibility</p>
            <p>Digital capability → assisted digital support</p>
            <p>When we over-focus on who is being excluded, we lose sight of why they’re being excluded, and how those reasons can apply to all users</p>
            <p>People can forget that…</p>
            <ul>
            <li>people aren’t the problem</li>
            <li>it’s design that excludes </li>
            <li>exclusion can happen to everyone</li>
            </ul>
