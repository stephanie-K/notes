          <h3>Cyd Harrell- From service to infrastructure</h3>
          <p><a href="assets/images/conf/Service-to-Infrastructure-SDinGov 2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slides</a></p>
          <p> Public servant make more design decision than the entire design industry, but they don't always have the tools, or the training or the strucutre to make it easy to do great service design</p>
          <p>"I'm still not sure if this is a service as such or if what I'm doing is really design"</p>
          <p>system to help when working with institutions that are not a conventional service: <strong><a href=" https://stephenanderson.medium.com/when-customer-journeys-dont-work-arcs-loops-terrain-4f7f8ac6df4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arc, loop and terrain - Stephen Anderson </a></strong></p>
          <p>arc: short narrative sequences we use to string together a series of loops. = stories, paths, flows, or any similar series of events. They are like journeys but not end to end one</p>
          <p>You might end up with lots of loops , each with several loops</p>
          <p>the terrain is the context on which the service takes place</p>
          <p>Accuracy: if we try to be comprehensive and precise, we risk being unreadable by a large part of the audience. Whose accurate understadning are we aiming for? Depends on the context, on the layers</p>
          <p>pace layers:</p>
          <p><a href="assets/images/conf/pace-layers.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="img-half-width" src="assets/images/conf/pace-layers.png"/></a></p>
          <p>Good social & digital infrastructures let institutions provide abundantly for their members, as you can focus on what really matters</p>
          <p>In the 21st century, we interact with long-timescale institutions via short-timescale technologies.</p>
          <p>When service designs fail, policy fails. But when policy doesn’t support people, service design isn’t enough.</p>
          <p>When service designs fail, institutions survive but public trust is damaged.</p>
          <p>When institutions lack the infrastructure to support people, we need to work on the deeper layers.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure may be unevenly distributed, poorly fitted, outdated</p>

          <h3>Martin Wright - Consequence scanning</h3>
          <p>A structured, repeatable process designed to extract, categorise and prioritise consequences. It’s a decision making process </p>
          <p>we are so focus on delivering under tight deadlines that it cn be hard to think of the consequences - good or bad. Important to try to predict them so we can mitigate the bad ones and encourage the good ones</p>
          <p>Consequences can be: unintentded, intended, good or bad. Not mutually exclusive: unintended is not always bad, intended ones not always good.</p>
          <p>Work best if the idea is not too new, ideally work with a diverse group who understand what the idea is</p>
          <p>the process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>list the consequences</li>
            <li>classify consequences (good or bad, (un)intended)</li>
            <li>group consequences into categories (usually by theme or relation)</li>
            <li>prioritise consequences (high, medium, low)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>After a consequence scanning exercise, you should be left with a prioritised, classified and categorised list of consequences agreed by the group.</p>
          <p>Each consequence could require different approaches for example.</p>
          <p>This process works best when participants can be honest and open</p>

          <h3>Co-creating employment support for people aged over 50 in Greater Manchester - Humanly</h3>
          <p>Can immerse in groups as usual, so attedned online event, got slots and recruits people this way</p>
          <p>Local organisations shared opportunities to get involves, circulated our surveys on social media, Facebook better to engage older people, and for offline recruitement: flyers given in local food bank, post office, put through doors in the local area (that one was unsuccessful), 
            most effective methods was via locola organisation who were already engage with this people </p>
            <p>created kits of activities for participants including some in easy read for people to send it back in pre-paid envelop</p>
            <p>How they have informaed wider stakeholders: regular newsletter, brownbags (lunch time sessions) on the service design process, ad-oc presentations at relevant webinars - website pages and blogs</p>

          <h3>Personas are dead! long live personas - Carolina Pizatto</h3>
          <p>Persona have become templated / the content is too specific, but not useful</p>
          <p>No demographic data, no photographs, no salaries or interests, no name and no gender</p>
          <p>interviewed, then code it (create a code books), then tag all the transcript - let the data guide you so you don't have bias. Then spot the patterns </p>

          <h3>Researching sensitive topics with people in vulnerable situations - Julie Sun - cxpartners</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>establish trust</li>
            <li>get the language right</li>
            <li>include champions</li>
            <li>have support available</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Be careful with the choice of words: survivor not victim for example (women's aid) - might be good to ask the person how they want to be referred ? - identity really matters</p>
          <p>used gender neutral scenario - make the space feel safe. check with them prior to the meeting</p>
          <p>SMI: serious mental health</p>
          <p>Listen to the language they use, reflect and play back to them. Do not rush</p>

            <li>focus on fewer key research objectives</li>
            <li>plan for extra time (tech, switching, decompress)</li>

          <h3>Bringing data to the service design table - collaborating to meet user needs and policy intents - Edafe Onerhime</h3>
          <p>Some questions you can start answering if you have the right data to measure the impact of your service:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is your service equitable and easy to access for all citizens who need to use it?</li>
            <li>Who is using your service right now? Are they the people you intended to help or do you need to rethink this?</li>
            <li>where are the users of your public service located? Where d they live? Where do they work? Where do they access your public service?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Data is: text, numbers, images, anything we would like to store, it can be sound too. Anything we can analyse and use.</p>
          <p>How do you bring data people to your service table?</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start where you are</strong>: you can reap the benefits of data no matter what state or stage your public service is in</li>
            <li><strong>Be clear on the why</strong>: you don't need all, or any of the answer. You do need to be clear on why this public service exists or is being commissioned.</li>
            <li><strong>Speak the same language</strong>: do you call a spade a spade? Is your customer actually a client? having a common language pays dividends for your team and for onboarding data people</li>
            <li><strong>Be an intelligent customer</strong>: have the 'domain expertise' on your team to explain clearly waht you're doing, why you're doing it, how things fit together, and where the gaps, risks, or known problems are</li>
            <li><strong>Make data literacy a team priority</strong>: everyone on your team should have basic data skills: or be put on the path to get them. Having a pool of people who know how to use data means less pressure on the 'data person'</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ley skills to look for in 'data people:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Communication: can they explain what data is needed for a general audience as well as a technical audience?</li>
            <li>Analytical mindset: Can they help you break down what data you need, when you need it, and describe how it will help your public service be effective?</li>
            <li>Knowledge of emerging technologies and solutions: do they have broad knowledge of what's avaialble to use or are they dedicated to using a single solution?'</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Key take aways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Public are under pressure-being informed by data will help your service swim not sink.</li>
            <li>You don't need all the answers upfront - it helps to be an intelligent customer and build a data literate team.</li>
            <li>This means starting where you are, being clear about why your service exists and speaking the same language</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Feedback loops for services are all the things that happen between making a decision and using the result of that decision to make a new decision.</p>
          <p>What if your serive only gets used once every year or longer? (Census for example)</p>
          <p>Advices:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you can shorten the time it takes to get through the loop, do it! (avoid being in a long loop!)</li>
            <li>If you can't shorten the loop, but can still use plausible proxies, that's still good</li>
            <li>But if you can't shorten the loop: it has to be easy to hand off person to person / easy to run indefinitely</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Running a long expreriment: measuring impact</p>
          <p>De-jargon: outcome --> the change we want to see // Impact --> why it how-dwp-used-the-easy-read-format-to-make-its-content-more-accessible</p>
          <p>Change we want to see: how did you know X was really a problem? // How could you know with more certainty?</p>
          <p>Project final reflection - post mortem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What were the project goals at the start? By the end?</li>
            <li>Where did we succeed? Fall short?</li>
            <li>What could have made it more impactful?</li>
            <li>If we check in in 6 months, what will tell us or not our work had lasting impact?</li>
            <li>What lessons are worth sharing more widely?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Delay in looking at results can be powerful</p>
          <ol>
            <li>it's ok to separate out information generation from harvesting</li>
            <li>the simpler the better</li>
            <li>reinforce a generational view of mission</li>
            <li>information harvesting will happen when people are ready for it</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>How to improve the inevitable survey - Caroline Jarret</h3>
          <p>The survey is a process for getting answers to questions from (a sample of) people for the purpose of getting numbers that you can use to make decisions</p>
          <p>
            <a href="assets/images/conf/survey-octopus1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="img-half-width" src="assets/images/conf/survey-octopus1.png"/></a>
            <a href="assets/images/conf/survey-octopus2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="img-half-width" src="assets/images/conf/survey-octopus2.png"/></a>
          </p>
          <p>& steps as a linear process:</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Goal</strong>: establish your goals for the survey --> questions you need answers to</li>
          <li><strong>Sample</strong>: decide who to ask and how many --> people you invite to answer</li>
          <li><strong>Questions</strong>: test the questions --> questions people can answer</li>
          <li><strong>Questionanaire</strong>: build the questionnaire --> questions people can interact with</li>
          <li><strong>Filedwork</strong>: run the survey from invitation to follow --> people actually answer</li>
          <li><strong>Responses</strong>: clean and analyse the data --> answers</li>
          <li><strong>Reports</strong>: present the results --> decisions</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Establish your goals for the survey: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you want to know</li>
            <li>why do you want to know</li>
            <li>What decision will you make based on these answers</li>
            <li>What number do you need to make the decision</li>
          </ul>

          <p>"I'm not sure" : where does this come from, is it an interaction issue? what is the person thinking?</p>

          <h3>Inclusive remote engagement - Humanly</h3>
          <p>What do we mean by user engagement?</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Co-production</strong>: People who will be using a service or product have equal decision-making power throughout design and delivery</li>
            <li><strong>Co-creation (co-design)</strong>: People who use services work with professionals to design and create</li>
            <li><strong>Consultation</strong>: Users have the opportunity to provide feedback, experiences and/or ideas at particular points in the development process</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To break down the barriers to digital engagement</p>
          <ul>
            <li>offer 121 training to participants in advance</li>
            <li>allow additional time (20-30min) prior to a workshop for an intro activity, so participlant can play with the tool</li>
            <li>ensure 121 support is provided (for example, give a phone number to call for help during the workshop)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>off alternative, like mailing activites and designing kits that people can use at home that people can use without the researchers being present, diaries studys </p>
          <p>include pictures of the various steps including what it shoud look like at the end so people know what to expect</p>
          <p>Card sorting was hard even with clear instructions, asking to take photo is hard. Simplify with spreadsheet for example</p>
          <p>for participants with learning disability, they send disposable camera for example - to adapt the activity - or allow audio recording of activities - maybe WhatsApp?</p>
          <p>for learning disabilities, engage early:</p>

          <p>Design activities around people's circumstances</p>
          <ul>
            <li>consider the person's living environment</li>
            <li>think about the best time of the day for people to engage with activities or interviews especially if they have caring responsibilities</li>
            <li>creating a rapport remotely maybe hard so factor this into your planning taking more time to build relationships</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Products and services as catalysts for systems change in children’s services - Rhiannon Creasey / Barnados</h3>
          <p>no slides</p>
          <p>to chose what type of work you are going to do together:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>make sure everyone as a shared understanding of the various terms: co production, co design, consultations, engagement</li>
            <li>understand the motivations of each person taking part: buold skills? give their opinion, being kept informed?</li>
            <li>what conditions do you need to be able to do the work</li>
          </ul>
          <p>interesting to see how the design evolved organically ot system change:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>children asked what they would have needed the first time they arrived: list of items, products, like toothbrush</li>
            <li>once the packet is done and they start to test, they realise they needed a lot of information as well, so add a leaflet with a lot of information</li>
            <li>then design the conversation around providing the pack as children said they don't just want to find this on their bed but need this conversation to feel welcome</li>
            <li>started thinking why all this wasn't provided before and look at the policy itself: system change</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Ten ethical questions</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What is design’s relationship to power and privilege?</li>
            <li>Which humans do we center when we say, “Human-Centered Design”?</li>
            <li>How can designers say no to work when we need to pay off _______?</li>
            <li>Design is often sink or swim: why is drowning even an option?</li>
            <li>How do designers decide which people-in-need to serve?</li>
            <li>How do we wean design’s addiction from whiteness?</li>
            <li>Why do designers prefer to help people in another country, before helping people in their own backyard?</li>
            <li>Why does philanthropy, not community, set the agenda for social change?</li>
            <li>What’s the cost of speaking up? And what’s the cost if we don’t?</li>
            <li>What right do I have to do this work?</li>

        <p>Problem in service design for the queer community:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having to come out on a regular basis to your GP … No I’m sure I’m not pregnant (for a woman even though your status is ‘married’ (...but to another woman)</li>
          <li>If doing the effort on one part of the service ‘Mx’ option for online forms but once on the phone or face to face, the staff didn’t know what to do with ‘Mx’ or how to say it</li>

        <p>Functionality that are problematics and uncomfortable or worse:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Photos from ‘your memories’ targeted ads, </li>
          <li>Avoid using ‘he’ ‘she’ in your content</li>

        <p>Lou Downe:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure your service is safe
          <li>Is the service a place where the user feels that their needs are understood and represented in a way that makes them feel as if they will be accepted and comfortable using your service?</li>

        <p><a href="http://sarah-drummond.com/full-stack-service-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full Stack Service Design</a></p>
        <p>We are asking users to be experts of our own system</p>
        <p><strong>We need to design our organisation and systems to work for users</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Every organisation is a collection of micro design decisions, made on a daily basis that form our user experience</strong>.</p>
        <p>Design thinking is something inherent within human cognition; it is a key part of what makes us human. (Nigel Cross – Design Historian)</p>
        <p>We accept that things were the way they are because they’ve always been that way.</p>
        <p>Conscious design: when we create design where we ask people to do thing in a certain way, we have considered it</p>
        <p>Unconscious design, we don’t really think about the stuff, we don’t test it before we deliver it. This costs people. We have created systems that don’t solve problems. They create more work, cost us more to run and take us away from the frontline</p>
        <p>You can have the best design ops, the best tools, designers and funding in the world, but the user experience can still be terrible.</p>
        <p>We ALL have the ability to make conscious design decision that aid users. If our systems are to work, we have to learn how to consciously design together.</p>
        <p>The fact that you have lots of designers do not necessarily means you have a user centred organisation.</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/fullstack.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="img-half-width" src="assets/images/fullstack.png"/></a></p>
        <p>On one side, there are the user experience, the business processes but on the other hand you also have the infrastructure,( the system and technology), the organisation and system (governance, finance, resources, procurement, organisational structure, skills and roles, culture and power, the intent, measurement and incentives, business model, policy, mission, values and ethics.</p>
        <p>What good looks like?</p>
        <p>Service are made of 1000s of decisions before we even get to the point of designing the ‘user experience’</p>
        <p>Policy, government models, all these are material you can bend and play with when you design.</p>
        <p><strong>Bring the organisation with you.</strong> </p>
        <p>User centred organisations are a weak link sport. </p>
        <p><strong><em>“to truly be design infused, the organisation must ensure every influencer of a project has that same design literacy and fluency” – Jared Spool</em></strong></p>
        <p>We must build a basic design literacy across organisations and systems to enable user experiences that work for people. </p>
        <p>Organisations tend to sprint to build design and UX teams lifting and shifting services online, usually with a ‘digital lens’</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/sarah-drummond-sofa-conf.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="img-half-width" src="assets/images/sarah-drummond-sofa-conf.png"/></a></p>
        <p>Design team that moved from being dormant to be sprinting will be poorly commissioned by the organisation with hard delivery timescale, minimised budget, difficult policies to navigate.</p>
        <p>But organisation that actually spend time in the starting block, will understand design, and has built buy-in across departments, designing from an end-to-end perspective.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>Don’t build toolkit or over think ops, deliver value first, then learn how to repeat and scale what you did</strong></p>
        <p>First start building literacy and fluency in making design decisions at all levels of the stack by showing what good looks like and putting products and services in the hands of decision makers.</p>
        <p><strong>Defining a good project:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feasibility (it is technically, operationally and financially feasible?</li>
          <li>Measurable impact (can we achieve easy to measure impact in a short period?</li>
          <li>Capability building (will this support the building of design capabilities and minds in the organisation?</li>
          <li>Building a movement (will it build momentum and bring others on board across other departments?</li>
          <li>Political and strategic persuasion (does it fit a strategic stream of work we can attach it to?</li>
          <li>User experience (does it make an obvious improvement to the user experience?</li>
          <li>Under the radar (do we need to work under the radar to give ourselves space to experiment?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“we didn’t realise how important the language was until we were walked through the service stage by stage.”</p>
<br>
        <p>For me, the greatest part of the process had to be changing people’s mind-sets. Initially we weren’t given the go ahead to work with elected members. After taking senior management in housing through the process, they go onboard, organised information and training workshops. I skipped back to the office.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>Our job is communication:</strong> </p>
        <p>10% of our work is ideas</p>
        <p>90% of design is convincing people to agree with you</p>
<br>
        <p>GDS: The strategy is delivery</p>
        <p>Why did you not deliver things?</p>
        <p>We spend too long creating strategies and not enough making.</p>
<br>
        <p>We can’t just make things; we need to take the strategic role of what we’re making seriously. Strategy starts before design but continues with designing.</p>
<br>
        <p>Talk in the language of the people you want to listen before you introduce Service Design</p>
        <p>Care as much about who is round the table, as what is on the table.</p>
        <p><strong>Show what good look like!</strong></p>
        <p>Make friends by improving the user experience for Staff, involve them in the process by working in the open.</p>
        <p>Build communities of interest and find your early adopters</p>
        <p>Build networks, don’t beat down silos</p>

        <p>first pair is mother and child (.)<br>
          all other relations start in pair . _ .<br> 
          when we come together in a pair, we share a story, this is the most perfect device for memories ( O )<br> 
          when they are shared, they become yarn, and new things are create and new thing are learnt in between (the circle in the middle)<br>
          the truth of all knowledge is an aggregate of different point of view, there no single truth or point of view, all truths, all knowledge is best in aggregate<br>
          this is different from consensus.
        </p>
        <p>Increase vs growth: A system with lots of agents/nodes (people for example) with an agency in a complex adaptive system, they have to exchange information all the time.<br>
        Aborigen people don't have a growth system, they have an increase system. Metaphore of the brain: you don't need to grow your brain to be smarter, you need to increase the number of connections and relations</p>
        <p>5 different ways to come to knowledge:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>learning through observation</li>
          <li>passing on knowledge</li>
          <li>passing of the yarning (tell the storie)</li>
          <li>memorising through deep listening</li>
          <li>thinking and reflections</li>
        </ul>
       
          <p><strong>Learning through observation</strong><br>
            you see the whole process first, then you come in and do some small parts of it, and gradually, you build this up. There is a lot of observation, it’s a very practical way of learning.
          </p>

          <p><strong>3 Principles/protocoles for complex  adaptive systems</strong><br>
            <strong>Connection</strong> -  (agent needs to connect with as many relation as you can) - you start with pairs and end up with an exclusive group with a specif interest but if stays like that it will stagnates so it needs relation<br>
            <strong>Relation</strong> - they nedd to network with other groups and to exchange with them (so exchanges within the group and with other groups) <br>
            <strong>Diversity</strong> - you need to make sure you are distinct for the others agents, and you need to connect to as many diffeeent agents as dissimilar from you as possible<br>
            <strong>Interaction</strong> / exchanges , this will allows you to evolve <br>
            <strong>Adapt</strong>
          </p>

            <li>Measuring everything is measuring nothing. Focus on measuring that are truly central to the experience</li>
            <li>Get agreement within the team that a certain KEI is important. Disagreement results in ignoring KEIs and not taking action. Create a shared understanding and acceptance of what’s being measured</li>
