        <h3>Full Stack Service Design - Sarah Drummond</h3>
        <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/431223419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vimeo video - password is SofaConf</a></p>
        <p>We are asking users to be experts of our own system</p>
        <p><strong>We need to design our organisation and systems to work for users</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Every organisation is a collection of micro design decisions, made on a daily basis that form our user experience</strong>.</p>
        <p>Design thinking is something inherent within human cognition; it is a key part of what makes us human. (Nigel Cross – Design Historian)</p>
        <p>We accept that things were the way they are because they’ve always been that way.</p>
        <p>Conscious design: when we create design where we ask people to do thing in a certain way, we have considered it</p>
        <p>Unconscious design, we don’t really think about the stuff, we don’t test it before we deliver it. This costs people. We have created systems that don’t solve problems. They create more work, cost us more to run and take us away from the frontline</p>
        <p>You can have the best design ops, the best tools, designers and funding in the world, but the user experience can still be terrible.</p>
        <p>We ALL have the ability to make conscious design decision that aid users. If our systems are to work, we have to learn how to consciously design together.</p>
        <p>The fact that you have lots of designers do not necessarily means you have a user centred organisation.</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/fullstack.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="img-half-width" src="assets/images/fullstack.png"/></a></p>
        <p>On one side, there are the user experience, the business processes but on the other hand you also have the infrastructure,( the system and technology), the organisation and system (governance, finance, resources, procurement, organisational structure, skills and roles, culture and power, the intent, measurement and incentives, business model, policy, mission, values and ethics.</p>
        <p>What good looks like?</p>
        <p>Service are made of 1000s of decisions before we even get to the point of designing the ‘user experience’</p>
        <p>Policy, government models, all these are material you can bend and play with when you design.</p>
        <p><strong>Bring the organisation with you.</strong> </p>
        <p>User centred organisations are a weak link sport. </p>
        <p><strong><em>“to truly be design infused, the organisation must ensure every influencer of a project has that same design literacy and fluency” – Jared Spool</em></strong></p>
        <p>We must build a basic design literacy across organisations and systems to enable user experiences that work for people. </p>
        <p>Organisations tend to sprint to build design and UX teams lifting and shifting services online, usually with a ‘digital lens’</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/sarah-drummond-sofa-conf.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="img-half-width" src="assets/images/sarah-drummond-sofa-conf.png"/></a></p>
        <p>Design team that moved from being dormant to be sprinting will be poorly commissioned by the organisation with hard delivery timescale, minimised budget, difficult policies to navigate.</p>
        <p>But organisation that actually spend time in the starting block, will understand design, and has built buy-in across departments, designing from an end-to-end perspective.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>Don’t build toolkit or over think ops, deliver value first, then learn how to repeat and scale what you did</strong></p>
        <p>First start building literacy and fluency in making design decisions at all levels of the stack by showing what good looks like and putting products and services in the hands of decision makers.</p>
        <p><strong>Defining a good project:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feasibility (it is technically, operationally and financially feasible?</li>
          <li>Measurable impact (can we achieve easy to measure impact in a short period?</li>
          <li>Capability building (will this support the building of design capabilities and minds in the organisation?</li>
          <li>Building a movement (will it build momentum and bring others on board across other departments?</li>
          <li>Political and strategic persuasion (does it fit a strategic stream of work we can attach it to?</li>
          <li>User experience (does it make an obvious improvement to the user experience?</li>
          <li>Under the radar (do we need to work under the radar to give ourselves space to experiment?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“we didn’t realise how important the language was until we were walked through the service stage by stage.”</p>
<br>
        <p>For me, the greatest part of the process had to be changing people’s mind-sets. Initially we weren’t given the go ahead to work with elected members. After taking senior management in housing through the process, they go onboard, organised information and training workshops. I skipped back to the office.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>Our job is communication:</strong> </p>
        <p>10% of our work is ideas</p>
        <p>90% of design is convincing people to agree with you</p>
<br>
        <p>GDS: The strategy is delivery</p>
        <p>Why did you not deliver things?</p>
        <p>We spend too long creating strategies and not enough making.</p>
<br>
        <p>We can’t just make things; we need to take the strategic role of what we’re making seriously. Strategy starts before design but continues with designing.</p>
<br>
        <p>Talk in the language of the people you want to listen before you introduce Service Design</p>
        <p>Care as much about who is round the table, as what is on the table.</p>
        <p><strong>Show what good look like!</strong></p>
        <p>Make friends by improving the user experience for Staff, involve them in the process by working in the open.</p>
        <p>Build communities of interest and find your early adopters</p>
        <p>Build networks, don’t beat down silos</p>

        </ul>
        <p>first pair is mother and child (.)<br>
          all other relations start in pair . _ .<br> 
          when we come together in a pair, we share a story, this is the most perfect device for memories ( O )<br> 
          when they are shared, they become yarn, and new things are create and new thing are learnt in between (the circle in the middle)<br>
          the truth of all knowledge is an aggregate of different point of view, there no single truth or point of view, all truths, all knowledge is best in aggregate<br>
          this is different from consensus.
        </p>
        <p>Increase vs growth: A system with lots of agents/nodes (people for example) with an agency in a complex adaptive system, they have to exchange information all the time.<br>
        Aborigen people don't have a growth system, they have an increase system. Metaphore of the brain: you don't need to grow your brain to be smarter, you need to increase the number of connections and relations</p>
        <p>5 different ways to come to knowledge:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>learning through observation</li>
          <li>passing on knowledge</li>
          <li>passing of the yarning (tell the storie)</li>
          <li>memorising through deep listening</li>
          <li>thinking and reflections</li>
        </ul>
       
          <p><strong>Learning through observation</strong><br>
            you see the whole process first, then you come in and do some small parts of it, and gradually, you build this up. There is a lot of observation, it’s a very practical way of learning.
          </p>

          <p><strong>3 Principles/protocoles for complex  adaptive systems</strong><br>
            <strong>Connection</strong> -  (agent needs to connect with as many relation as you can) - you start with pairs and end up with an exclusive group with a specif interest but if stays like that it will stagnates so it needs relation<br>
            <strong>Relation</strong> - they nedd to network with other groups and to exchange with them (so exchanges within the group and with other groups) <br>
            <strong>Diversity</strong> - you need to make sure you are distinct for the others agents, and you need to connect to as many diffeeent agents as dissimilar from you as possible<br>
            <strong>Interaction</strong> / exchanges , this will allows you to evolve <br>
            <strong>Adapt</strong>

          <p>looks like a lot of teens don't want to engage in video calls because they are body conscious, so would rather only use sound or chat</p>
          <p>some people don't want to be digitally included (some have been reached and said they didn't want that even with help and guidance, only face to face when it's possible again)</p>
          <p>how do we engage with people with learning disabilities (potentially can't read, can't use transports, might not be verbal) how do we get them involved? no solution but suggestions like making workshops more visual, using collage to express your views, I guess it's tough one to break and not that relevant for SE but interesting discussions.</p>

          <p>lots of people from Co-op and from Barnados, or working for councils.</p>
          <p>the theme picked was how do we show the  value of SD.</p>
          <p>Surprised that all these nice blog posts from Co-op....no one reads them internally, so it's really SD talking to other people in the SD community - made me think that we (designer) really under estimate how much we are in a bubble - (link with another meetup yesterday about unravelling unconscious bias) because we mostly interact with people who are interesting in this, read about that, tweet about that, blog about it, we don't always realise that hardly anyone outside that bubble do?</p>
          <p>quite a few problems with PO who are not doing their role as PO or even understand what their role is about</p>
          <p>words used being problematic, for example a guy from Barnados, said he stopped saying 'Agile' he just says 'iterative process', avoid having people overthinking and putting things under 'Agile' that should not be there</p>
          <p>and one woman who said she had been struggling to advocate in a council for 10 years... her philosophy now is: befriend those who are the most open and ready to hear about SD and UCD, and let the more reticent come to you. They will come to you in the end ....</p>
          <p>Say what we don't do</p>

          <p>echo chamber, confirmation bias. We are in a social bubble with social media, remote working increase and reinforce it</p>

          <p>negative bias (more likely to believe the info if it's negative)</p>
          <p>gender bias (less paper, publication from women at the moment - because child care)</p>
          <p>access to tech, to a quiet room, space time</p>
          <p>neuro diverse people: harder to read facial expression, Zoom is cognitive intensive, hard to express your opinion in Zoom harder to interrupt</p>

          <p>Feeling of belonging in an organisation, need to be embedding in culture and policy</p>

          <p>VR training to remove bias, step in someone else shoes, embodiement, but needs to be with group discussion, need to be ongoing discussion.</p>

          <p>Need different kind of voice, some dissonance, not a box ticking exercice, do they have a voice in decision making</p>

          <p>we tend to notice what stand out, different skin colour, different accent, you don't fit in template</p>

          <p>understand why people think differently (racial , gender, else) focus on the system itself, which leads to the differences, it's better discussion to change the society</p>
          <p>be an ally (don't just acknowledge your privilege, stand up for others)</p>

              Skyscanner see themselves as a travel agency, but the customers see them as ‘only’ flights sellers – something they are trying to change (<strong>Oli Mival</strong> – UR head at Skyskanner)</li>
              
              <li>Blockbusters were seeing themselves as a DVD and video providers, and they failed to adapt, but Netflix position themselves as entertainment providers and could adapt much better</li>

            <li>Measuring everything is measuring nothing. Focus on measuring that are truly central to the experience</li>
            <li>Get agreement within the team that a certain KEI is important. Disagreement results in ignoring KEIs and not taking action. Create a shared understanding and acceptance of what’s being measured</li>
