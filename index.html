            <h3>From SDinGOV 21 - Martin Wright - Consequence scanning</h3>
            <p>A structured, repeatable process designed to extract, categorise and prioritise consequences. It’s a decision making process </p>
            <p>we are so focus on delivering under tight deadlines that it cn be hard to think of the consequences - good or bad. Important to try to predict them so we can mitigate the bad ones and encourage the good ones</p>
            <p>Consequences can be: unintentded, intended, good or bad. Not mutually exclusive: unintended is not always bad, intended ones not always good.</p>
            <p>Work best if the idea is not too new, ideally work with a diverse group who understand what the idea is</p>
            <p>the process:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>list the consequences</li>
              <li>classify consequences (good or bad, (un)intended)</li>
              <li>group consequences into categories (usually by theme or relation)</li>
              <li>prioritise consequences (high, medium, low)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After a consequence scanning exercise, you should be left with a prioritised, classified and categorised list of consequences agreed by the group.</p>
            <p>Each consequence could require different approaches for example.</p>
            <p>This process works best when participants can be honest and open</p>

            <p>Cynefin is a Welsh word (Dave Snowden is Welsh). It means approximately "The place(s) where I belong." <strong>Cynefin is a way of making sense of the world</strong>: of human organisation primarily.</p>
            <p>This is not a model. A model seek to represent reality while a framework is a way of looking at reality. It's not about making categories but about making sense'.<br>
                In categorisation models, Framework precedes data<br>
                In sense making models: data precedes framework<br>
                There are 5 domains, 2 ordered on the right, 2 unordered on the left and disorder in the middle<br>
                <strong>You need to use the appropriate method for the appropriate domain</strong>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disorder</strong>: you don't know what type of system you're in - it's an unhappy place'</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple / obvious:</strong> For problems in this domain, the relationship between cause and effect is obvious: if there is a problem, we all know how to fix it. (More recently, this domain is labelled ‘Obvious’, because Simple sounds like Easy. It may be Obvious we need to dig a tunnel through a mountain, but it’s not Easy…) Organisations define ‘best practice’ to tackle Obvious issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complicated:</strong> In this domain, there are repeatable and predictable chains of cause and effect, but they are not so easy to discern. A jet engine is sometimes given as a metaphorical example of such complicatedness. In this domain, problem-solving often involves the knowledge of an expert, or an analytical process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaotic: </strong>In this domain, we can’t discern a relationship between cause and effect at all, because the interacting elements are so loosely constrained. Chaos is usually a temporary condition, because a pattern will emerge, or somebody will take control and impose some sort of order. In Chaos, you don’t have time to assess carefully: decisive action is needed, in the hope that good things will emerge and can be encouraged. (And as Dave sometimes says, ‘Light candles and pray!’)</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex:</strong> This is a domain in which various ‘actors and factors’ – animate and inanimate – do respond to constraints, and can be attracted to influences, but those constraints and influences are relatively elastic, and there are many interactions and feedback loops that are hard to fathom. Such a system is more like a biological or ecological system than a mechanical one. Cognitive Edge practitioners have a battery of techniques for experimentation in this space, as Tony would soon describe.</li>
                    <li><strong>The cliff between Obvious and Chaos</strong>: if people act with complete blind conviction that things are really simple and obvious, and Best Practice is followed without question, the organisation can be blindsided to major changes happening in their world. One day, when you pull the levers, you don’t get the response you have come to expect, and you have a crisis on your hands. And if you simply try to re-impose the rules, it can make things worse.</li>

            <h3>When participants have inappropriate behaviour/comments (Slack Thread)</h3>

            <p>This conversation was instigated after a researcher had a couple of incidents with participants expressing '-phobic' views, but we're keen on developing something that's a bit more catch-all for a variety of inappropriate behaviours. We're able to take some resources from our telephony teams in terms of actual lines to take, but the difficulty is understanding the nuance of applying those to user research. For example some of the sticking points are:</p>
            <p>Where is the line between stopping users from making potentially harmful comments and censoring their opinion?</p>
            <p>How should a researcher report on inappropriate comments/behaviour during a session?</p>
            <p>What level of follow-up actions should be taken (how do you facilitate debrief/reflection space for the researcher, should we do anything about the participant?)</p>
            <p>How do we build this guidance into daily practice so that people are aware of it before they need it, and feel empowered to use it as needed?</p>
            <p>How else can we incorporate good allyship into UCD practice?</p>
            <p>Really interested to hear any thoughts, opinions, or suggestions of what resources/guidance is already out there that people can share!</p>
<br>

            <p>I'm not a UR person but I do have a background in ethics. One important differentiation to make is between "potentially harmful" (I don't agree/like this opinion) and "illegal or dangerous speech" (I genuinely believe they are going to cause physical harm).</p>
            <p>Something you don't agree with can be legitimate opinion, e.g. not thinking gay marriage is morally acceptable, and should not be censored according to all mainstream theories of ethics.</p>
            <p>Advocating violence against LGBT people just because they are LGBT is not morally acceptable and all mainstream theories of ethics would (generally, with some nuances) say it's acceptable to disregard/censor it (usually through a legal mechanism of some sort).</p>
            <p>Sometimes people will have opinions that go against what is perceived to be the mainstream, but ethical systems are a social construct rather than an unbreakable law of physics (you can argue til the cows come home about the ethics of abortion, but the law of gravity just is).</p>
            <p>How you go about helping URs when they hear something they don't agree with is different to how you deal with hearing something that may require a report to a legal body (police, a professional body, etc).</p>
            <p>So, whilst it's tricky to do so, it would probably be helpful to work out generalised guidelines for what is "potentially harmful" vs what is "illegal or dangerous speech", and for that you should engage with your legal team. Once you have those boundaries in place you can then decide on what actions to take for each.</p>
            <p>In the subject of allyship you need to decide if you are taking an active position on subjects about which people can have legitimate differences of opinion without being morally "wrong", or whether you will remain neutral (as long as someone doesn't go into "illegal or dangerous speech"). If you are not going to remain neutral then you should have a written list of positions that are acceptable/unacceptable and decide how you will handle research subjects who do not take what you consider to be acceptable positions. You should get agreement from your URs about what is on this list. </p>
<br>
            <p>all of what Rob has said plus one extra thing - how you’ll report on it. Talking about whether you delete the comments from footage, or caveat it before any reporting of it. Using a dept’s guidelines can also help, for example, if a department talks about their comms imagery reflecting the diversity of UK society then that means being able to discard any comments about said imagery relating to race (yep, sadly this happened on one team and we had to talk the UR out of feeding that back to the stakeholders)</p>
<br>
            <p>It's definitely helpful to have conversations about this in advance before you start a piece of research - e.g. reminding URs (and others who are observing sessions) that this may happen, and agreeing an approach to dealing with it. You mentioned about daily practice but I think good moments to talk about this are: when you're starting work on a new product or in a new phase, or when new people join the team. This of course applies not only to inappropriate behaviour but other things such as sensitive topics being discussed.</p>
<br>
            <p>This is an interesting topic and one my team have already grappled with a little while ago. As a team we have a user research panel of over 750 people - in contacting people on our panel, my team have received comments back from this which are unacceptable.</p>
            <p>I agree with the above about censoring opinions, but what I would say is that as professionals, we also have a duty of care to our staff and other than giving a heads up and having a discussion, I'm not sure that's really been mentioned. I fundamentally do not think it is acceptable for staff to have to be put in those positions unnecessarily. And I would also say that unless you are doing research on something where those views are actually relevant, if it's not relevant to the research, it should be stopped.</p>
            <p>As an example, one of my staff members contacted our user research panel and received an email back from an individual who directed racist views to my staff member. We have also had an individual email us with racist views and providing viewpoints on immigration - which is absolutely nothing to do with anything our team do or cover in research (no, there's not even a tangent where it would become relevant). In both of these examples, I would absolutely not invite those people to take part in research knowing that my staff could be subject to racism or other abuse.</p>
            <p>In response to these incidents (and a few others), we have developed a team policy that covers researcher safeguarding and sets out our approach. We remove individuals from our panel if an incident occurs, and we also specify in our policy that staff members should be empowered to deal with the situation in front of them i.e. you're in an interview, it goes badly, as a researcher you can end the interview immediately, escalate to line manager to be dealt with further etc.</p>
            <p>In terms of when it is relevant for research to explore topics and areas which could be more likely to draw out views that are potentially harmful, then it's more about the structure you put in place around your researchers. There is a whole world of research, academic and otherwise, about conducting research in sensitive areas which also deal with researcher safeguarding and wellbeing (e.g. during my PhD, there were other students research domestic violence, homelessness, legalising abortion in Ireland etc. and they all drew on ethical positions which provide guidelines for researchers).</p>
<br>
            <p>It might be worth thinking about other research data sources, such as website feedback forms. I've certainly opened a couple of those and not expected the volume of abusive/inappropriate comments in there - it's been fine, but I would have appreciated an advance heads up about that.</p>

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/doteveryone/status/1176111055812071424?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What's the “Last Ten Centimetres”? - Twitter thread</a></p>
            <p>People told us about how technologies made by able-bodied designers don't take into account their lived experiences. <br>
            E.g. how do you use an Alexa if you have a condition affecting your lungs and you cannot raise your voice above a whisper?</p>
            <p>It's similar to the “last mile problem” of the logistics industry. <br>
             Optimised supply chains are increasingly efficient at moving goods from factory to port to shipping container to lorry to national distribution hub to local warehouse.</p>
             <p>But the last part that remains unpredictable and challenging: <br>
             Navigating unfamiliar narrow streets to find an address and get a box into customers’ hands.<br>
            And this makes up about 1/3 of total delivery cost.</p>
            <p>To realise the benefits of new tech in care, the “Last Ten Centimetres” is critical:<br>
            For telecare appointments to save GPs’ time, someone needs to set up the WiFi and make sure it’s working.</p>
            <p>For SMS reminders to improve NHS appointment attendance, someone needs to make sure they are readable or that text-to-speech works. </p>
            <p>And for robot-supported physiotherapy to improve stroke rehab, someone needs to make sure the straps and grips are comfortable for different hands all affected by hugely
                varied pain, palsy or paralysis.</p>
            <p>What's needed to cross those “Last Ten Centimetres”?<br>
            Equip carers with the skills to effectively use tech to augment their vital skills of empathy, creativity and social intelligence. </p>

                Ask a question in response to the presentation of an issue, or about a problem to resolve or a proposal put forward.<br>
                Start alone, then in pairs, then foursomes, and finally as a whole group.<br>
            </p>
            <p>What is needed:</p>

                <li>Paper for participants to record observations and insights</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Time needed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Silent self-reflection by individuals on a shared challenge, framed as a question. <strong>1 min.</strong></li>
                <li>Generate ideas in pairs, building on ideas from self-reflection. <strong>2 min.</strong></li>
                <li>Share and develop ideas from your pair in foursomes (notice similarities and differences). <strong>4 min.</strong></li>
                <li>Ask, “What is one idea that stood out in your conversation?” Each group shares one important idea with all (repeat cycle as needed). <strong>5 min.</strong></li> 
            </ul>

            <p>
                Most, if not all, maturity models are context free.<br>
                For example, Adrian Howard points out that maturity for a 30 person company is entirely different to that of a multinational.<br>
                The maturity model conflates level of effectiveness with learning path”<br>
                For a maturity model to provide utility it must reflect the context, and provide some guidance for improvement that can be selected dependent on that context.<br>

            <h3>Facilitating</h3>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/on-being-a-workshop-facilitator-b1bdbc224f64" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>On being a workshop facilitator</strong></a></p>
            <p>Facilitation: the act of helping other people to deal with a process or reach an agreement without getting directly involved in the process or discussion yourself.</p>
            <p>You should record each expectation on a whiteboard to be reviewed at the end of the workshop.</p>

Participatory design and codesign workshops depend on facilitation to engage a range of people with differing types of knowledge and lived experiences.</p>

            <p>The typical meeting favors the powerful—individuals who find it easy to say their ideas. The ranking members of the team will say their opinions first, either out of seniority, respect, or intimidation.</p>
            <p><strong>The “Writing Down Ideas First” Trick</strong></p>
            <p>You ask meeting participants to brainstorm independently for a few minutes, by writing their ideas down before you ask for people to share.</p>
            <p>This is perfect for when you need the team to brainstorm ideas or solutions.</p>
            <p>Writing their ideas down first means those ideas are free from the influence of others in the room. Assigning a minimum number of things to write down helps them break away from the initial, obvious answers. When asked to share, they are more likely to state an original concept even if it’s counter to what others have said.</p>
            <p><strong>The “Finger Voting” Trick</strong></p>
            <p>Everyone votes simultaneously on an attribute, using only the fingers on one hand. A quick discussion about the extreme votes gets the salient points out fast. A quick re-vote determines the team’s consensus viewpoint.</p>
            <p>By having each person vote at the same time, it avoids the influence of others in the room. The quick follow up discussion often explores different points-of-view on an equal setting. The re-vote makes sure everyone is heard, while staying with the group’s consensus.</p>
            <p>This is perfect for when you need to assign relative scores or ratings to ideas. We use it to rate the attributes of an ideal design, which we’ll use as a framework for subsequent critiques.</p>
            <p>First, you need to establish a scale for each item on the list. For example, if you’re scoring importance, you might suggest a score of 1 means ‘not important’ and a score of 5 means ‘critically important.’ (It sometimes helps to have a midpoint defined, like a score of 3 means ‘nice to have.’)</p>

            <p>
                Giving the presenter a chance to show their work without being interrupted by a string of questions turns out to be pretty important.<br>
                There are four roles in any critique session. The two everyone’s most familiar with are the presenter and the audience (also sometimes called the critics). However, every session also needs a facilitator and a recorder.<br>
                Recording all the ideas coming in is important and really hard to do, even for seasoned adult presenters, when simultaneously trying to listen and take in ideas. Having another person record the group’s thoughts gives the presenter confidence that everything’s being recorded without needing to juggle listening with note-taking.<br>
                Pixar has an interesting rule for their dailies: the presented work should be at least 25% done and no more than 75% completed. It should be a solid work-in-progress.<br>

            <p>How to compose a successful critical commentary:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>you should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way"</li>
              <li>you should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement)</li>
              <li>you should mention anything you have learned from your target</li>
              <li>only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Behaviour of people in online meeting (with Leonie Watson) - netiquette: Mute yourself! clarify use of the chat - no bip/chime when someone join - careful with setting of the meeting - people need to be really careful about when it’s good to use the chat and when not</p>
            <p>Remember that some of your audience may :</p>
            <ul>
              <li>not see all or parts of the presentation</li>
              <li>struggle to understand parts of the presentation</li>

            <h3>Before the event</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Give an agenda, explain the goal of this event, who will be attending and the expectations from the participants</li>
                <li>When the event lasts more than an hour, plan for a break and announce it ahead</li>
                <li>Ask if anyone as some special requirements, anything they might need to know before the event that is not mentioned in the agenda</li>
                <li>Make sure the language used in the invitation is inclusive and make people feel safe to share anything they might request from you</li>
                <li>If online and using some specific tools, provide some guidance or tutorials for people who might not be familiar with them</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Always ask your participants what they need</strong>. You can't plan for everything. Give them the opportunity to tell you.</p>
            <p> When organising an event, presentation, webinar or meeting, it’s good practice to offer your participants an opportunity to let you know how you can make the session more accessible to them.</p>
            <p>You could provide contact details to get in touch with you, or build it into the booking process (similar to how many booking services let participants add dietary requirements). You could also allow people to respond anonymously to an online survey.</p>
            <p><strong>Share materials ahead of the session</strong></p>
            <p>Sending the presentation and any other relevant materials to your audience before the session starts, means your participants can view the presentation on their own device if they need to. People with low vision can zoom in and resize their own version of the presentation, and people with technology restrictions who can’t see your shared screen can follow along from their own device.</p>
            <p>It can also help give people with cognitive disabilities more time to read through and familiarise themselves with the content of the presentation.</p>

            <h3>During the event</h3>
            <p><strong>Record the session</strong></p>
            <p>This isn’t just helpful for people who couldn’t attend the live session. It also means participants can re-watch the session if there was something they missed or didn’t understand.</p>
            <p><strong>Add captions and transcripts</strong></p>
            <p>Using live captions or BSL interpreters means more users can join in the live session – which is important if there’s interactive elements or opportunities to ask questions. If this isn’t possible, you should always at least add captions to the recording of the session. Creating a transcript of the session can also be useful.</p>
            <p><strong>Learn how to use your tools well</strong></p>
            <p>Many virtual tools come with built-in accessibility tools. For example, many meeting tools allow you to ‘pin’ a user to the screen, meaning that they’ll always be visible. This is particularly useful for users who always need to see a BSL interpreter, or need to be able to lip read during the presentation.</p>
            <p>Get to know the tools you’re using to find the best ways to make them accessible, and to help your audience or participants to use them in a way that helps them.</p>

            <h3>The presentation</h3>
            <p>A presentation is usually involved in some form during most meetings, virtual events and physical events. How you deliver the presentation is important, but so is the formatting of the presentation itself.</p>
            <p><strong>Leave some space for captions</strong></p>        
            <p>If you are presenting in webinars or online conferences, leave empty space at bottom of each presentation slide for two lines of captions.</p>
            <p>When you don’t, captions will overwrite your slide content.</p>
            <p><strong>Use large font sizes</strong></p>
            <p>Presentations are often smaller when you share your screen than they would be on your own screen, and some people may be watching on a smaller screen than you. Consider this when choosing your font size.</p>
            <p><strong>Reduce the amount of text</strong></p>
            <p>It’s tempting to overload your slides with information, but it’s often counter-productive. Participants may feel overwhelmed with the amount of text or may struggle to read it and listen to the presentation at the same time. It also often forces you to use a smaller font.</p>
            <p>Instead, keep the text on slides to a minimum, or consider splitting text across more than one slide.</p>
            <p>A good article on this: <a href="https://seomba.substack.com/p/good-slides-reduce-complexity" target="_blank">Good Slides Reduce Complexity</a></p>
            <p><strong>Colours and contrasts</strong></p>
            <p>Make sure the text colour you’re using contrasts well with the background of your presentation. Tools such as <a href="https://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com" target="_blank">Tanaguru contrast finder</a> can help you check.</p>
            
            
            <h3>During the presentation</h3>
            <p><strong>Describe visual content</strong></p>
            <p>Remember that not everyone can see what you’re seeing. Describe what’s on the slide, including any graphs or images.</p>
            <p>If your participants are using video, it’s also good to describe any reactions that you see. For example, “I can see Joe is shaking his head” or “I can see most of you are nodding your heads”.</p>
            <p>If an audience member asks a question in the chat, make sure to read out the question before you answer.</p>
            <p>A <a href="https://feather.ca/inclusion/describing/" target="_blank">good read about this, explaining how to audio describe your presentation</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Use good lighting</strong></p>
            <p>Make sure you’re presenting in a well-lit room so that participants who need to lip read can see you clearly.</p>
            <p><strong>Speak slowly and clearly</strong></p>
            <p>Use a mic! Even if you have a loud voice. Make sure people hear you.</p>
            <p>Your audience may include people with hearing impairments or cognitive impairments, or people who speak English as a second language. Make sure to speak slowly and clearly so that people can hear what you’re saying and have time to process it.</p>
            <p>It’s also a good idea to pause in between slides. This lets your audience process what you’ve just said and read what’s on the next slide.</p>
            <p><strong>Plan breaks</strong></p>
            <p>If your session is longer than an hour, you should factor in short breaks. As well as providing a chance for participants to take a bathroom break, get a drink or even just move about, it also reduces cognitive load for users who may feel overwhelmed. It gives a chance to process the information that’s been shared and finish taking notes.</p>
            <p><strong>Managing questions and participation</strong></p>
            <p>Make sure that all participants are muted while someone is speaking to reduce background noise.</p>
            <p>Don’t pressure users to turn their cameras on or ask questions out loud. Always give the opportunity to ask questions or share ideas via a chat feature or interactive tools like Slido.</p>
            <p>In collaborative sessions and meetings, it’s likely that participants will ask questions or share updates, opinions or information out loud. Depending on the nature of the session, you may want to introduce formal ways of requesting to speak, for example entering a question in the chat, or using a ‘raise hand’ feature.</p>
            <p><strong>Make sure each participant has a way to take part to the discussion and ask questions whatever their abilities</strong></p>

            <h3>Making physical events accessible</h3>
            <p>If you’re running a physical event or workshop, you should still follow any applicable guidelines on this page. If you’re using a presentation, make sure it uses a large font and isn’t over-crowded with text. Speak clearly, describe visual elements out loud and plan plenty of breaks. However, there are a few additional considerations you’ll need to remember when hosting a physical event.</p>
            <p><strong>Physical access</strong></p>
            <p>When you host an event in a physical location rather than a virtual space, there are additional access requirements you need to consider.</p>
            <p>While you’re unlikely to find a venue that can provide everything, here’s a list of things that will make your venue accessible: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lift and ramp access – not just to the building, but to each floor and room</li>
              <li>Lift buttons that can be accessed by someone using a wheelchair</li>
              <li>Automatic doors or doors that can be opened with a button</li>
              <li>Disabled toilets and gender-neutral toilets</li>
              <li>Disabled parking and non-disabled parking – ideally these should be free</li>
              <li>Nearby access to public transport</li>
              <li>A quiet room</li>
              <li>A nursing room and changing facilities for parents with babies</li>

              <p><strong><a href="https://www.euansguide.com" target="_blank">Euan’s guide can help you find an accessible venue</a></strong></p>

            <p><strong>Communicate accessibility to your audience</strong></p>
            <p>Your event page should contain details about how accessible the event is. Make sure these are clear and honest – if there’s a ramp into the building but no lift to the venue room, make sure people are aware of this.</p>
            <p>There may also be other information that people might want to know about your venue. Some people with cognitive disabilities or anxiety may want to know, in detail, exactly how to enter your building and where to go or what to do once inside. Pictures can help to show what attendees should be looking for.</p>
            <p>It’s also good to let people know if food and drink is allowed in the venue, and what facilities – like shops or food outlets – are nearby.</p>
              <p>When something is not available (no disabled toilets for example) do tell your participants ahead. They might still be able to attend and make their own arrangement.</p>
            <p><strong>Recording, captions and translators</strong></p>
            <p>Try to record as much of the event as possible, especially key parts like speakers. Make sure to provide captions and ideally a transcript before sharing the recordings.</p>
            <p>If possible, try to provide a live captioning service or BSL interpreter on the day of the event. This means more people can get involved on the day instead of having to catch up afterwards.</p>

            <h3>After the event</h3>
            <p>Ask for honest feedback. What worked well and what didn’t. That way you can improve the next event.</p>
            
            <h3>Inclusive remote engagement - Humanly - SDinGOV</h3>
            <p>What do we mean by user engagement?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Co-production</strong>: People who will be using a service or product have equal decision-making power throughout design and delivery</li>
              <li><strong>Co-creation (co-design)</strong>: People who use services work with professionals to design and create</li>
              <li><strong>Consultation</strong>: Users have the opportunity to provide feedback, experiences and/or ideas at particular points in the development process</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To break down the barriers to digital engagement</p>
            <ul>
              <li>offer 121 training to participants in advance</li>
              <li>allow additional time (20-30min) prior to a workshop for an intro activity, so participlant can play with the tool</li>
              <li>ensure 121 support is provided (for example, give a phone number to call for help during the workshop)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>off alternative, like mailing activites and designing kits that people can use at home that people can use without the researchers being present, diaries studys </p>
            <p>include pictures of the various steps including what it shoud look like at the end so people know what to expect</p>
            <p>Card sorting was hard even with clear instructions, asking to take photo is hard. Simplify with spreadsheet for example</p>
            <p>for participants with learning disability, they send disposable camera for example - to adapt the activity - or allow audio recording of activities - maybe WhatsApp?</p>
            <p>for learning disabilities, engage early:</p>

            <p>Design activities around people's circumstances</p>
            <ul>
              <li>consider the person's living environment</li>
              <li>think about the best time of the day for people to engage with activities or interviews especially if they have caring responsibilities</li>
              <li>creating a rapport remotely maybe hard so factor this into your planning taking more time to build relationships</li>
            </ul>

            <p>“You can’t really see anything, but…” — how often have you heard that in presentations cause things were too small/too many things were on a slide?</p>
            <p><strong>Here’s a litmus test</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the presentation on your mobile phone</li>
                    <li>Hold it 40 cm/15" away</li>
                    <li>Read it – in portrait</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Reminder to people presenting in webinars, online conferences: <br>
                    Leave empty space at bottom of each presentation slide for two lines of captions.
                    When you don't, captions will overwrite your slide content.</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>Lightning talks</strong></h3>
        
            <p>They are designed to be short presentations between five and ten minutes long, but are usually capped at five minutes.</p>
            <p>The conferences are held in order for individuals to be able to share their ideas and concepts to people who have experience in the specific field.</p>
            <p>Lightning talks are brief which <strong>requires the speaker to make their point clearly</strong> and <strong>rid the presentation of non-critical information</strong>. </p>
            <p>This causes the audience to be more attentive to the speaker and gain a broader array of knowledge from the presentations given.</p>
            <p>Slides may be discouraged, and a single computer running a presentation program is used by all speakers.</p> 
            <p>In general lightning talks are given in a format that can include slides but if so, <strong>the speaker must be careful not to read the details which they include</strong>.</p>

            <p>Some insights from the video above, about remote working as an opportunity</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Neurodiverse people can struggle with tread on social media, especially dyslexic people. Sequence do not always make sense to them</li>
                    <li>Autistic people can struggle online has they have very little to go on to understand others online. They might also struggle to speak when not asked a specific question</li>
                    <li>Asking what could help, can help autistic people to focus on their needs. They don't always realise how they feel and what they need</li>
                    <li>'User manual for me' can explain what works for someone and what doesn't for them, what might create problems or anxiety (see below)</li>
                    <li>Diversity Training is not everything, we need to look at what it means for our organisation and how to integrate it in everything (34min in the video), so for example for Health and Safety: can everyone access this information? can everyone understand it and does it work for them? May be we don't have wheelchair users or blind employee yet, but if we did? or a visitor? Would it work for them? What support do we have for care giver? For someone transitioning?</li>
                    <li>Have a productive conversation with soemone (without being nosy) to see how you can support them in their role (43min in): what do you need? what do you have right now? is this enough / efficient? what can we do to make your working at home life balance better?</li>
                    <li>Every bias you remove from the work place makes you more productive, the more diverse your workplace, the more innovative you are</li>
                </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Start with the problems you’re trying to solve that impact others</li>
                <li>Step 2: Identify the people who share these problems</li>
                <li>Step 3. Contact people and propose a meeting</li>
                <li>Step 4. Agree on shared problems and set shared objectives</li>
                <li>Step 5. Agree ongoing ways of working</li>

            <p>From this video:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>service landscape helps common understanding among different organisation</li>
                <li>helps finding duplication and gaps in the way the service is provided</li>
                <li>to create a service community, you need to have a problem to solve which would benefit from other organisation's input (or team, or profession or function etc...)</li>
                <li>policy team don't talk to delivery team and sometime, policy can't be implemented as a result, failing the user</li>
                <li>we use problems as a way to focus collaboration on outcome and services as a way to define boundraries of collaboration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example:</p>

            <p>How to do it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>identify the problems you are trying to solve</li>
                <li>identify who can help you solve those problems</li>
                <li>get in touch with them and propose a service community</li>
                <li>agree together on what you're trying to achieve and how you will achieve it</li>
                <li>plan an activity (repeat over and over and over ....again)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-strategy-bcaa3fda9a31"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WTF is Strategy?</strong></a></p>
            <p><strong>The framework: </strong>before we talk about strategy, it needs to be contextualized within a few other concepts primarily because strategy never exists (or shouldn’t exist) in isolation. Here are the high-level definitions of the different components from a product-centric view:</p>
            <uL>
                <li><strong>Mission:</strong> This is a statement that describes the problem you are setting out to solve, typically including who you are solving it for. This is often set at the company level, but can also be defined for a product or product line.</li>
                <li><strong>Vision:</strong> This is the idealized solution that addresses the problem you’ve articulated in your mission. A product vision typically has just enough viability to be relatable, but is still devoid of the details that may hamper your imagination. Product vision is also the goal post and rallying point for your product — it paints the picture of how your product will make an impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a set of principles and decisions — informed by reality (e.g. market forces, laws of physics, data) and caveated with assumptions — that you commit to ahead of development to ensure the greatest likelihood of success in achieving your vision. Your strategy may evolve with the introduction of new data. If there’s a big shift in strategy while the mission and vision remain constant, it’s called a <strong>pivot</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Roadmap:</strong> This is the manifestation of your strategy in concrete steps towards your product vision, inclusive of rough milestones and timelines. This, too, often changes given new data. (As I like to say, a roadmap is defunct as soon as it’s published.)</li>
                <li><strong>Execution:</strong> This is the day-to-day activities along the path of the roadmap. This is where you do the hard work to build, launch, and iterate, all the while collecting the necessary data to inform any changes in your roadmap and strategy.</li>
            </uL>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/strategy1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/tech/strategy1.png"/></a></p>
            <p>As the gradient and size of the diagram above suggests, the mission, by design, is both vague and broad. The further down you go in the stack, the more concrete and narrow these concepts become.</p>
            <p>Strategy within this framework bridges the gap between <strong>what you aspire to be</strong> and <strong>what you are doing.</strong></p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/strategy2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/strategy2.png"/></a></p>
            <p>In other words, <strong>strategy represents the set of guiding principles for your roadmapping and execution tasks to ensure they align with your mission and vision.</strong></p>

            <p>Tips when turning PDF into word: If the PDF ends up broken up over lots of lines, there's no need to fix it manually. Just go to find and replace, type ^p into find, and one space into replace<br>
                You can also so this with line breaks  if ^p doesn't work, just use ^l instead <br>
                ^p replaces hard returns but also useful is ^w - replaces all spaces (so replace it with one white space) and ^l ( that’s a l for llama) which gets rid of soft returns.</p>
