            <p>Agile programming is all about going slow<br>
                The promise of agile isn’t speed but rather it’s about not building up technical debt and design debt. <br>
                <strong>One of the remarkable side effects of agile done right, is that lots of unnecessary features are identified early in the process. Agile is a pretty good tool for discovering what exploratory code should not be turned into production code.</strong><br>
                <strong>the tactical sloth of agile yields significant advantages in strategic speed. If you slow down enough to be truly agile, you will get things done faster. </strong>

            <p>We must focus on our interactions with each other, instead of insisting our tools dictate our work.</p>
            <p>Sitting together and demonstrating a working idea can push a design forward much faster than any amount of specifications or non-interactive diagrams.</p>

            <p>View on Digital Transformation - change needs to be sustainable (long term efficiencies), need to get the skills to adapt and understand the change, not so much all the underlying technologies
                being humble about what you don’t know and embracing the need to constantly learn and change.<br>
                And one thing that is critical in the public sector is that we lead inclusively and insist on having diverse design and development teams. We can only serve the needs of all citizens if our teams are reflective of society.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Digital strategy</strong> = predict, understand and implement the changes required to successfully compete online in an ever-changing digital environment.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Process models:</strong> how we go to A to B, visualise how works get done </p>
            <p><strong>Process flow:</strong> illustrate how work is completed - human focused (also called system flows when analysing processes involving system</p>

            <p><strong>Use cases:</strong> description of how goals are achieved through a series of actions and processes, they focus on functional qualities of systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Use case components: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>an action phrase is used for the name,</li> 
                <li>a brief description and list of actors are included</li>
                <li>the organisation benefit is described, helpful for context and prioritisation</li>
                <li>preconditions and triggers help us to understand the circumstances under which the action may take place</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>alternate flows</strong> are included, indicating how event may unfold<br>
                <strong>Exception flows</strong> indicate when and how issues ,ay arise that result in failure<br>
                <strong>Post conditions</strong> describes the changed state following action taking place
            </p>
            <p><strong>Use cases </strong>are good for test --> UAT, they can sometime substitute for a formal list of requirements. Functional and non functional requirements should be kept separated. In every case requirements derive from them.</p>
            <p><strong>User stories</strong> are similar to use cases but for agile, whereas a use cases is more waterfall. Creating a user story: user / action / value (as a , I want to, so I). They have acceptance criteria.</p>
            <p><strong>INVEST model:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Independent</li>
                <li>Negotiable</li>
                <li>Valuable</li>
                <li>Estimable</li>
                <li>Small</li>
                <li>Testable</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Epics</strong> are a related set of stories. Stories should typically be addressable in one iteration of an agile project.</p>
            <p>Stories don't need to be estimable from the start, if might be during the project development.</p>
            <p><strong>Rule models: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>depict limitations on conduct of work</li>
                <li>may be imposed on project, project's result, or a combination</li>
                <li>rules may be internal, contractual, regulatory or legal in nature</li>
                <li>source and context of rules key to understanding and adherence</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Interface models:</strong> illustrates how and in what context processes overlap/data is transferred. Helpful when analysing how users and systems interact, and how systems transfer work and data to each other</p>
            <p><strong>User interface flows: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>simulates or visualises how users interact with a system</li>
                <li>models range from simple flowcharts to full blown simulations</li>
                <li>may focus on specific functionality or represent an entire system/application</li>
                <li>most helpful for high level usage early on (a feature might be too deep in the architecture</li>
                <li>useful to use and or create during elicitation to better understand requirements</li>
                <li>flows are traceable back to requirements, but don't represent requirement directly</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Activity of drawing out information from stakeholders and other sources. 
                Stakeholder usually only bring their own point of view for requirement, you need to looks for all aspects, to elicited this information, understand the steps needed to get the requirements. 
                You also need to find the data sources useful in verifying needs, and translating needs into useful requirements

            <p>CRM or Customer Relationship Management is a strategy for managing an organisation's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
                When people talk about CRM, they are usually referring to a CRM system, a tool that is used for contact management, sales management, productivity, and more. The goal of a CRM system is simple: Improve business relationships.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What does a CRM solution do?</strong><br>
                CRM solutions streamline processes and increase profitability in your sales, marketing, and service divisions. A strong CRM solution is a multifaceted platform where everything crucial to developing, improving, and retaining your customer relationships is stored. Without the support of an integrated CRM solution, you may miss growth opportunities and lose revenue because you’re not maximizing your business relationships.<br>                
                Imagine misplacing customer contact information, only to learn that your delay pushed your client into the arms of a competitor. Or, picture your top two salespeople pursuing the same prospect, resulting in an annoyed potential customer and some unfriendly, in-house competition. Without a centralized program where your people can log and track customer interactions, your business falls behind schedule and out of touch.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The fundamentals of customer relationship management</strong><br>CRM tools make the customer-facing functions of business easier. They help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>centralise customer information</li>
                <li>automate marketing interactions</li>
                <li>provide business intelligence</li>
                <li>facilitate communications</li>
                <li>track sales opportunities</li>
                <li>analyze data</li>
                <li>enable responsive customer service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Running a successful business is no simple task. When marketing campaigns, data analysis, meetings, customer care, and more all happen simultaneously, you need a powerful CRM solution to bring all these functions together in one place</p>

            <h3 id="cyn">Cynefin framework</h3>
            <p><a href="http://cognitive-edge.com/videos/cynefin-framework-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cynefin® framework introduction by Dave Snowden</strong></a></p>
            <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/144154325" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Video: Cynefin & Complexity: A Gentle Introduction - star trek bits inside</strong></a></p>
            <p>Cynefin is a Welsh word (Dave Snowden is Welsh). It means approximately "The place(s) where I belong." <strong>Cynefin is a way of making sense of the world</strong>: of human organisation primarily.</p>
            <p>This is not a model. A model seek to represent reality while a framework is a way of looking at reality. It's not about making categories but about making sense'.<br>
                In categorisation models, Framework precedes data<br>
                In sense making models: data precedes framework<br>
                There are 5 domains, 2 ordered on the right, 2 unordered on the left and disorder in the middle<br>
                <strong>You need to use the appropriate method for the appropriate domain</strong>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disorder</strong>: you don't know what type of system you're in - it's an unhappy place'</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple / obvious:</strong> For problems in this domain, the relationship between cause and effect is obvious: if there is a problem, we all know how to fix it. (More recently, this domain is labelled ‘Obvious’, because Simple sounds like Easy. It may be Obvious we need to dig a tunnel through a mountain, but it’s not Easy…) Organisations define ‘best practice’ to tackle Obvious issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complicated:</strong> In this domain, there are repeatable and predictable chains of cause and effect, but they are not so easy to discern. A jet engine is sometimes given as a metaphorical example of such complicatedness. In this domain, problem-solving often involves the knowledge of an expert, or an analytical process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaotic: </strong>In this domain, we can’t discern a relationship between cause and effect at all, because the interacting elements are so loosely constrained. Chaos is usually a temporary condition, because a pattern will emerge, or somebody will take control and impose some sort of order. In Chaos, you don’t have time to assess carefully: decisive action is needed, in the hope that good things will emerge and can be encouraged. (And as Dave sometimes says, ‘Light candles and pray!’)</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex:</strong> This is a domain in which various ‘actors and factors’ – animate and inanimate – do respond to constraints, and can be attracted to influences, but those constraints and influences are relatively elastic, and there are many interactions and feedback loops that are hard to fathom. Such a system is more like a biological or ecological system than a mechanical one. Cognitive Edge practitioners have a battery of techniques for experimentation in this space, as Tony would soon describe.</li>
                    <li><strong>The cliff between Obvious and Chaos</strong>: if people act with complete blind conviction that things are really simple and obvious, and Best Practice is followed without question, the organisation can be blindsided to major changes happening in their world. One day, when you pull the levers, you don’t get the response you have come to expect, and you have a crisis on your hands. And if you simply try to re-impose the rules, it can make things worse.</li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>Digitisation</strong>: Digitization refers to creating a digital representations of physical objects. In other words, digitization is about converting something non-digital into a digital representation or artefact.</p>
            <p><strong>Digitalisation</strong>: Digitalization refers to enabling, improving or transforming business process by leveraging digital technologies (e.g., APIs) and digitized data. That means that digitalisation presumes digitization.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital Transformation</strong>: Digital transformation is the profound transformation of business activities, competencies, and business models to fully leverage the opportunities of digital technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Paradigm of Change model</strong>: an organisation can be described with the following three components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>strategy (What-Should-Be)</strong>: strategy describes what an organisation wants to accomplish. In other words, where the company should be. Strategy is transformational.</li>
                <li><strong>tactics (What-Will-Be)</strong>: tactics describes how the organisation is accomplishing the goal. In other words, what the company will do. Tactics is transitional.</li>
                <li><strong>operations (What-Is)</strong>: operations describes what an organisation is doing. In other words, what the company is right now. Operations is traditional.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Strategy, tactics, and operations are the components that describe the constant fluctuations of an organisation.</p>
            <p>The three components are depicted as Venn diagram in the following figure. As you see, they overlap. The intersection of strategy/tactics, strategy/operations, and tactics/operations is where the real power of APIs are.</p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/critical-design-thinking.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/critical-design-thinking.png"/></a></p>
            <p>It’s important to standardise processes to optimise them with respect to time, cost, and quality. When you standardise processes, you can define meaningful metrics, start measuring, and monitor KPIs.<br>
                Naturally, every organisation runs into business problems, which needs to be solved. To this goal, organisations typically apply <strong>critical thinking</strong> to solve business problems.<br>
                <strong>Critical thinking is the objective analysis of facts to form a judgement</strong><br>
                Hence, critical thinking is appropriate to solve business processes because you can analyse them and evaluate KPIs to make fact-based decision about what to improve or change.
            </p>
            <p><strong>An API solution</strong> consists of one or several APIs that solve an integration problem. More specifically, an API solution is an integration solution between computer systems to enable inter-communication.</p>
            <p>API solutions prospers within operations or the What-Is. The reasons are that the problems to solve are precise and the outcome measurable. Typical problems are integration of two computer systems or automation of business process X to improve speed and reduce costs.</p>
            <p>An API solution enables the automation of the interaction between computer systems. Automation may reduce significantly manual efforts and thus making processes cheaper and faster. Automation requires standardisation, which fosters higher quality.</p>
            <p><strong>An API product</strong> consists of one or several APIs that provide an interface to a value proposition. In other words, an API product consists of value proposition interfaces or rather VPIs. In contrast, API solutions consists of API, which don’t provide an interface to a value proposition. The value proposition of API solutions is creating the communication link between computer systems.</p>
            <p>API products help customers getting the job done. To this goal, API products address customer pains and offer gains. API products have a business model and thus creating value for both the organisation and its customers.<br>
                API products prospers within tactics or the What-Will-Be. The reasons are that the problems to solve are precise and the outcome measurable. Typical goal is to explore and find new business models thus, impacting the strategy it self. This is digital transformation in its core.

                <li><strong>Working Directory</strong> which holds the actual files</li>
                <li><strong>Index</strong> which acts as a staging area </li>

                <li>Make your changes 
                <li>Check if I had the latest changes 	<span class="code">git status</span></li> 
                <li>Add the changes: 			<span class="code">git add fileName or git add .</span>  (for all the files)</li>
                <li>Or to not include a file		<span class="code">git checkout filename</span> (changes will be deleted for that file)</li>

                <li>Then push your changes		<span class="code">git push</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Then <strong>pull request</strong> (branch I want my code to go to on the left, my branch on the right)<br>
            <strong>Commit message advice</strong> “use imperative – brief – ticket number”<br>
            <strong>If master has changed since I've branched</strong>, from my branch: <span class="code">git merge origin/master</span><br>
            <strong>To merge new branch to master, from master:</strong> <span class="code">git merge nameOfTheBranch</span></p>

            <p><strong>More commands:</strong><br>
            Create a new repository: 				<span class="code">git init</span><br>
            Create a working copy of a local repository: 		git clone /path/to/repository</span><br>
            If remote repository: 					<span class="code">git clone username@host:/path/to/repository</span><br>
            Remove a file from index				<span class="code">git rm fileName</span><br>
            Pushing the head of the local repository to remote rep: 	<span class="code">git push origin master</span><br>
            Update the local repository with remote changes: 	<span class="code">git pull</span><br>
            Delete a branch						<span class="code">git branch –d nameOfBranch</span><br>

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/doteveryone/status/1176111055812071424?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What's the “Last Ten Centimetres”? - Twitter thread</a></p>
            <p>People told us about how technologies made by able-bodied designers don't take into account their lived experiences. <br>
            E.g. how do you use an Alexa if you have a condition affecting your lungs and you cannot raise your voice above a whisper?</p>
            <p>It's similar to the “last mile problem” of the logistics industry. <br>
             Optimised supply chains are increasingly efficient at moving goods from factory to port to shipping container to lorry to national distribution hub to local warehouse.</p>
             <p>But the last part that remains unpredictable and challenging: <br>
             Navigating unfamiliar narrow streets to find an address and get a box into customers’ hands.<br>
            And this makes up about 1/3 of total delivery cost.</p>
            <p>To realise the benefits of new tech in care, the “Last Ten Centimetres” is critical:<br>
            For telecare appointments to save GPs’ time, someone needs to set up the WiFi and make sure it’s working.</p>
            <p>For SMS reminders to improve NHS appointment attendance, someone needs to make sure they are readable or that text-to-speech works. </p>
            <p>And for robot-supported physiotherapy to improve stroke rehab, someone needs to make sure the straps and grips are comfortable for different hands all affected by hugely
                varied pain, palsy or paralysis.</p>
            <p>What's needed to cross those “Last Ten Centimetres”?<br>
            Equip carers with the skills to effectively use tech to augment their vital skills of empathy, creativity and social intelligence. </p>

                Ask a question in response to the presentation of an issue, or about a problem to resolve or a proposal put forward.<br>
                Start alone, then in pairs, then foursomes, and finally as a whole group.<br>

                <li>Ask, “What is one idea that stood out in your conversation?” Each group shares one important idea with all (repeat cycle as needed). <strong>5 min.</strong></li>

            <p>
                Most, if not all, maturity models are context free.<br>
                For example, Adrian Howard points out that maturity for a 30 person company is entirely different to that of a multinational.<br>
                The maturity model conflates level of effectiveness with learning path”<br>
                For a maturity model to provide utility it must reflect the context, and provide some guidance for improvement that can be selected dependent on that context.<br>
                <strong>As with most improvement techniques the value exists in the conversation</strong>

            <p><a href="https://articles.uie.com/equalizing-opinions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Jared Spool: Equalizing Opinions: Two Simple Tricks for Meeting Facilitators</strong></a></p>
            <p>The typical meeting favors the powerful—individuals who find it easy to say their ideas. The ranking members of the team will say their opinions first, either out of seniority, respect, or intimidation.</p>
            <p><strong>The “Writing Down Ideas First” Trick</strong></p>
            <p>You ask meeting participants to brainstorm independently for a few minutes, by writing their ideas down before you ask for people to share.</p>
            <p>This is perfect for when you need the team to brainstorm ideas or solutions.</p>
            <p>Writing their ideas down first means those ideas are free from the influence of others in the room. Assigning a minimum number of things to write down helps them break away from the initial, obvious answers. When asked to share, they are more likely to state an original concept even if it’s counter to what others have said.</p>
            <p><strong>The “Finger Voting” Trick</strong></p>
            <p>Everyone votes simultaneously on an attribute, using only the fingers on one hand. A quick discussion about the extreme votes gets the salient points out fast. A quick re-vote determines the team’s consensus viewpoint.</p>
            <p>By having each person vote at the same time, it avoids the influence of others in the room. The quick follow up discussion often explores different points-of-view on an equal setting. The re-vote makes sure everyone is heard, while staying with the group’s consensus.</p>
            <p>This is perfect for when you need to assign relative scores or ratings to ideas. We use it to rate the attributes of an ideal design, which we’ll use as a framework for subsequent critiques.</p>
            <p>First, you need to establish a scale for each item on the list. For example, if you’re scoring importance, you might suggest a score of 1 means ‘not important’ and a score of 5 means ‘critically important.’ (It sometimes helps to have a midpoint defined, like a score of 3 means ‘nice to have.’)</p>

            <p><a href="https://medium.com/creating-a-ux-strategy-playbook/goods-bads-and-dailies-lessons-for-conducting-great-critiques-f2089046b274" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Goods, Bads, and Dailies: Lessons for Conducting Great Critiques - Jared Spool</strong></a></p>
            <p>
                Giving the presenter a chance to show their work without being interrupted by a string of questions turns out to be pretty important.<br>
                There are four roles in any critique session. The two everyone’s most familiar with are the presenter and the audience (also sometimes called the critics). However, every session also needs a facilitator and a recorder.<br>
                Recording all the ideas coming in is important and really hard to do, even for seasoned adult presenters, when simultaneously trying to listen and take in ideas. Having another person record the group’s thoughts gives the presenter confidence that everything’s being recorded without needing to juggle listening with note-taking.<br>
                Pixar has an interesting rule for their dailies: the presented work should be at least 25% done and no more than 75% completed. It should be a solid work-in-progress.<br>

            <p>Being able to respond quickly to what you learn beats any amount of predicting and planning. Embracing diversity means pushing decision-making to the frontline.</p>
            <p>if people are using “agile” to mean doing the same process only faster, even at the risk of burning out their people, then they’re Doing It Wrong.</p>
            <p>the real challenge to peddlers of TOMs and the like: agile transformation isn’t a one-off thing that you do to get from A to B – it’s a continuous culture of iterative improvement.</p>
            <p> We’ll have to break down the Berlin Wall between the bits of an organisation that create “strategy” and the bits that do “operations”</p>

            <p>Organisations use <strong>Business Process Modeling (BP Modeling)</strong> in order to visually document, understand, and improve their processes. A part of <strong>Business Process Management (BPM)</strong>, 
                BP Modeling has been used as an organisational tool to <strong>map out what is (or “as-is”) as a baseline</strong> and to <strong>determine the future (or “to-be”) with any improvements assimilated</strong>. BP Modeling visually represents all of the connecting activities, events, and resources of the process of a product or service to make it more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>Process modeling often uses <strong>Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)</strong>, a standard method of illustrating processes with flowchart-like diagrams that can be easily understood by both IT and business managers.</p>
            <p>Reasons to use BP Modeling are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>to create visual models of processes</strong> - Word-driven documentation is often not sufficient for employees to understand the way a process is performed. Backing it up with visual representations helps provide a comprehensive picture</li>
                <li><strong>align operations</strong> - With any new business strategy, keeping processes consistent after a change requires figuring out how to stay within the overall organizational strategy. Analyses are also performed to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and enable process agility</li>
                <li><strong>improve process communication </strong>- Communication is the key to all of the following tasks: formalizing existing processes (that were once informal knowledge), making consistent processes, eliminating guesswork with business rules, handling exceptions, providing regulatory compliance, ensuring business people are in charge, and supporting new initiatives</li>
                <li><strong>improve operational efficiency </strong>- Modeling processes promotes optimization by allowing simulation and illustrating needed improvements. This reduces cycle time and promotes better resource utilisation</li>
                <li><strong>gain competitive advantage </strong>- A process is better overall when it is constantly refined and aligned with its business’ strategies. This efficiency places the company in a forward-leaning position to be better than the competition</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="proc">Procurement</h3>
            <p>This is the process of finding, agreeing terms and acquiring goods, services or works from an external source, often via a tendering or competitive bidding process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services or works at the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared. Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimising risk, such as exposure to fraud and collusion.</p>

            <p>“You can’t really see anything, but…” — how often have you heard that in presentations cause things were too small/too many things were on a slide?</p>
            <p><strong>Here’s a litmus test</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the presentation on your mobile phone</li>
                    <li>Hold it 40 cm/15" away</li>
                    <li>Read it – in portrait</li>

            <p class="lead"><strong>Lightning talks</strong></p>
        
            <p>They are designed to be short presentations between five and ten minutes long, but are usually capped at five minutes.</p>
            <p>The conferences are held in order for individuals to be able to share their ideas and concepts to people who have experience in the specific field.</p>
            <p>Lightning talks are brief which <strong>requires the speaker to make their point clearly</strong> and <strong>rid the presentation of non-critical information</strong>. </p>
            <p>This causes the audience to be more attentive to the speaker and gain a broader array of knowledge from the presentations given.</p>
            <p>Slides may be discouraged, and a single computer running a presentation program is used by all speakers.</p> 
            <p>In general lightning talks are given in a format that can include slides but if so, <strong>the speaker must be careful not to read the details which they include</strong>.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>organisers and speakers should do things like: ensure the facility is accessible, speak clearly into the microphone, describe pertinent visuals, and other considerations listed on this page</li>
                <li>make your event and your presentations fully accessible to prepare for any situation</li>
                <li>presentations that are accessible to people with disabilities are also inclusive to many more audiences. For example, people with different learning styles and people who are not fluent in the language</li>
                <li>arrange for good Internet connection when needed</li>
                <li>consider accessibility when planning the schedule - leave enough time and warn ahead of changes</li>
                <li>make text and important visuals big enough to be read even from the back of the room</li>
                <li>use an easy-to-read font face</li>
                <li>use sufficient color contrast</li>
                <li>make provided material accessible</li>
            </ul>
                <p><strong>During the presentation</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Speak clearly</strong>: and avoid speaking too fast, so participants and sign language interpreters can better understand you and keep up.</p>
                <p><strong>Use simple language</strong>: avoid or explain jargon, acronyms, and idioms. For example, expressions such as “raising the bar” can be interpreted literally by some people with cognitive disabilities and can be confusing.</p>
                <p><strong>Give people time to process information</strong>: Pause between topics. When you ask if anyone has questions, some people with cognitive disabilities will need extra time to form their thoughts into words.</p>
                <p><strong>Be visible</strong>: and in good light when you talk, so participants can see your face. This helps some people hear and understand better. Be careful not to face away from the audience to read projected material, particularly if you don’t have a microphone.</p>
                <p ><strong>Use a microphone</strong>: some people might need the audio electronically, even in a small room. This includes people using <a href="#ald" class="termref">ALDs/hearing loops</a> and remote <a href="#cart" class="termref">CART</a> writers. Note that if you ask “Can everyone hear me OK?” some people might be uncomfortable saying that they cannot.</p>
                <p><strong>Ensure that all relevant sound is audible through the sound system</strong>: for example, if the audience doesn’t have a microphone, repeat their questions and comments into your microphone before replying.</p>
                <p><strong>Cover all displayed text</strong>: say all of the information that is on each slide. (This does not mean that you have to read the slide exactly as it is. It just means that you cover the visual information in what you say.)</p>
                <p><strong>Describe pertinent parts of graphics, videos, and other visuals</strong>: describe them to the extent needed to understand the presentation. (You usually do not need to describe decorative images.)</p>
                <p><strong>Describe other visual information</strong>: for example, a speaker asks people to raise their hands if they make their websites fully accessible. The speaker should then describe the visual response: “About half raised their hand”.</p>

            <p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-strategy-bcaa3fda9a31"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WTF is Strategy?</strong></a></p>
            <p><strong>The framework: </strong>before we talk about strategy, it needs to be contextualized within a few other concepts primarily because strategy never exists (or shouldn’t exist) in isolation. Here are the high-level definitions of the different components from a product-centric view:</p>
            <uL>
                <li><strong>Mission:</strong> This is a statement that describes the problem you are setting out to solve, typically including who you are solving it for. This is often set at the company level, but can also be defined for a product or product line.</li>
                <li><strong>Vision:</strong> This is the idealized solution that addresses the problem you’ve articulated in your mission. A product vision typically has just enough viability to be relatable, but is still devoid of the details that may hamper your imagination. Product vision is also the goal post and rallying point for your product — it paints the picture of how your product will make an impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a set of principles and decisions — informed by reality (e.g. market forces, laws of physics, data) and caveated with assumptions — that you commit to ahead of development to ensure the greatest likelihood of success in achieving your vision. Your strategy may evolve with the introduction of new data. If there’s a big shift in strategy while the mission and vision remain constant, it’s called a <strong>pivot</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Roadmap:</strong> This is the manifestation of your strategy in concrete steps towards your product vision, inclusive of rough milestones and timelines. This, too, often changes given new data. (As I like to say, a roadmap is defunct as soon as it’s published.)</li>
                <li><strong>Execution:</strong> This is the day-to-day activities along the path of the roadmap. This is where you do the hard work to build, launch, and iterate, all the while collecting the necessary data to inform any changes in your roadmap and strategy.</li>
            </uL>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/strategy1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/tech/strategy1.png"/></a></p>
            <p>As the gradient and size of the diagram above suggests, the mission, by design, is both vague and broad. The further down you go in the stack, the more concrete and narrow these concepts become.</p>
            <p>Strategy within this framework bridges the gap between <strong>what you aspire to be</strong> and <strong>what you are doing.</strong></p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/strategy2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/strategy2.png"/></a></p>
            <p>In other words, <strong>strategy represents the set of guiding principles for your roadmapping and execution tasks to ensure they align with your mission and vision.</strong></p>

            <p><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nodejs-acceptance-testing/table-of-contents"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Pluralsight on acceptance testing</strong></a></p>
            <p>Most applications have an API or presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data layer</p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/UATpyramid.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/tech/UATpyramid.png"/></a></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>unit tests</strong>: they cover a very small amount of code</li>
                <li><strong>integration tests:</strong> cover multiple modules in the system for compliance</li>
                <li><strong>acceptance tests</strong>: cover the system for high level compliance, is it ready to deliver?</li>
                <li><strong>UI tests</strong>: enter through the UI and test a specific flow</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Acceptance testing </strong>is about checking that the system as a whole behaves as it should. One acceptance tests might go end to end but it will still not cover the entire system but just one specific scenario: given a set of inputs, do I get these outputs. Instead you want to have a suit of acceptances suit that covers all the behaviours you care about.</p>
            <p><strong>Why writing acceptance tests:</strong> repeatable, gives confidence, les maintenance cost and less risk and fear.<br>
                When developing code they prevent you from doing too much regressions, offer guardrails, and is good for bug fixing.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Format of an acceptance test: </strong><br>
            set up (the data),<br>
            invoke,<br> 
            verify (the result) and <br>
            clean up (clear the data from the DB -from the set up)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3 essential steps with a slightly different name:</strong><br>
                Arrange ==  set up<br>
                Act == invoke<br>
                Assert == verify
            </p>
            <p>Every test should be clear, simple and if you can't write a simple test than the code probably need to be simplified (code smell detector)</p>
            <p class="lead">Red Green Refactor loop:</p>
            <p>
                write a red (a failing test = an expected behaviour that your system is failing to provide just now)<br>
                needs to fail for the right reason (test for the right thing)<br>
                write the green (write the code so the test pass, code should be simple)<br>
                once it works, you can refactor (= changing the structure of the code but not the functionality), <br>
                code should be cleaner and more extensible, then test the code again, it should pass.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>write a failed acceptance test for a use case that is not yet implemented</li>
                <li>implement each smaller piece with TDD </li>
                <li>repeat 2 ( implementing a small piece) until the acceptance test 1 passes</li>
                <li>repeat 1 to 3 until the feature is complete</li>
                <li>change UI to use new API feature</li>
            </ol>
            <p>At the end of a stage, if you have added value without removing any then you can ship!<br>
                when you release a code where the functionality is there but the user can't access it yet (UI not done yet), it's called: a <strong>dark release.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>By writing the test first, you are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>forced to decide the shape and function of endpoints before they exist</li>
                <li>helps you determine what constitutes a slice of value</li>
                <li>signals when the feature is ready to ship (even if dark release)</li>
                <li>gives you confidence the piece of value is complete</li>
            </ul>
