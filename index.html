            <p>View on Digital Transformation - change needs to be sustainable (long term efficiencies), need to get the skills to adapt and understand the change, not so much all the underlying technologies
                being humble about what you don’t know and embracing the need to constantly learn and change.<br>
                And one thing that is critical in the public sector is that we lead inclusively and insist on having diverse design and development teams. We can only serve the needs of all citizens if our teams are reflective of society.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Digital strategy</strong> = predict, understand and implement the changes required to successfully compete online in an ever-changing digital environment.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Process models:</strong> how we go to A to B, visualise how works get done </p>
            <p><strong>Process flow:</strong> illustrate how work is completed - human focused (also called system flows when analysing processes involving system</p>
            <p>Creating a process flow: </p>

            <p><strong>Use cases:</strong> description of how goals are achieved through a series of actions and processes, they focus on functional qualities of systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Use case components: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>an action phrase is used for the name,</li> 
                <li>a brief description and list of actors are included</li>
                <li>the organisation benefit is described, helpful for context and prioritisation</li>
                <li>preconditions and triggers help us to understand the circumstances under which the action may take place</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>alternate flows</strong> are included, indicating how event may unfold<br>
                <strong>Exception flows</strong> indicate when and how issues ,ay arise that result in failure<br>
                <strong>Post conditions</strong> describes the changed state following action taking place
            </p>
            <p><strong>Use cases </strong>are good for test --> UAT, they can sometime substitute for a formal list of requirements. Functional and non functional requirements should be kept separated. In every case requirements derive from them.</p>
            <p><strong>User stories</strong> are similar to use cases but for agile, whereas a use cases is more waterfall. Creating a user story: user / action / value (as a , I want to, so I). They have acceptance criteria.</p>
            <p><strong>INVEST model:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Independent</li>
                <li>Negotiable</li>
                <li>Valuable</li>
                <li>Estimable</li>
                <li>Small</li>
                <li>Testable</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Epics</strong> are a related set of stories. Stories should typically be addressable in one iteration of an agile project.</p>
            <p>Stories don't need to be estimable from the start, if might be during the project development.</p>
            <p><strong>Rule models: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>depict limitations on conduct of work</li>
                <li>may be imposed on project, project's result, or a combination</li>
                <li>rules may be internal, contractual, regulatory or legal in nature</li>
                <li>source and context of rules key to understanding and adherence</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Interface models:</strong> illustrates how and in what context processes overlap/data is transferred. Helpful when analysing how users and systems interact, and how systems transfer work and data to each other</p>
            <p><strong>User interface flows: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>simulates or visualises how users interact with a system</li>
                <li>models range from simple flowcharts to full blown simulations</li>
                <li>may focus on specific functionality or represent an entire system/application</li>
                <li>most helpful for high level usage early on (a feature might be too deep in the architecture</li>
                <li>useful to use and or create during elicitation to better understand requirements</li>
                <li>flows are traceable back to requirements, but don't represent requirement directly</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Activity of drawing out information from stakeholders and other sources. 
                Stakeholder usually only bring their own point of view for requirement, you need to looks for all aspects, to elicited this information, understand the steps needed to get the requirements. 
                You also need to find the data sources useful in verifying needs, and translating needs into useful requirements

            <p>CRM or Customer Relationship Management is a strategy for managing an organisation's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
                When people talk about CRM, they are usually referring to a CRM system, a tool that is used for contact management, sales management, productivity, and more. The goal of a CRM system is simple: Improve business relationships.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What does a CRM solution do?</strong><br>
                CRM solutions streamline processes and increase profitability in your sales, marketing, and service divisions. A strong CRM solution is a multifaceted platform where everything crucial to developing, improving, and retaining your customer relationships is stored. Without the support of an integrated CRM solution, you may miss growth opportunities and lose revenue because you’re not maximizing your business relationships.<br>                
                Imagine misplacing customer contact information, only to learn that your delay pushed your client into the arms of a competitor. Or, picture your top two salespeople pursuing the same prospect, resulting in an annoyed potential customer and some unfriendly, in-house competition. Without a centralized program where your people can log and track customer interactions, your business falls behind schedule and out of touch.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The fundamentals of customer relationship management</strong><br>CRM tools make the customer-facing functions of business easier. They help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>centralise customer information</li>
                <li>automate marketing interactions</li>
                <li>provide business intelligence</li>
                <li>facilitate communications</li>
                <li>track sales opportunities</li>
                <li>analyze data</li>
                <li>enable responsive customer service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Running a successful business is no simple task. When marketing campaigns, data analysis, meetings, customer care, and more all happen simultaneously, you need a powerful CRM solution to bring all these functions together in one plac<li></p>

            <p><strong>Digitisation</strong>: Digitization refers to creating a digital representations of physical objects. In other words, digitization is about converting something non-digital into a digital representation or artefact.</p>
            <p><strong>Digitalisation</strong>: Digitalization refers to enabling, improving or transforming business process by leveraging digital technologies (e.g., APIs) and digitized data. That means that digitalisation presumes digitization.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital Transformation</strong>: Digital transformation is the profound transformation of business activities, competencies, and business models to fully leverage the opportunities of digital technologies.</p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/digitalisation.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/digitalisation.png"/></a></p>
            <p><strong>Paradigm of Change model</strong>: an organisation can be described with the following three components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>strategy (What-Should-Be)</strong>: strategy describes what an organisation wants to accomplish. In other words, where the company should be. Strategy is transformational.</li>
                <li><strong>tactics (What-Will-Be)</strong>: tactics describes how the organisation is accomplishing the goal. In other words, what the company will do. Tactics is transitional.</li>
                <li><strong>operations (What-Is)</strong>: operations describes what an organisation is doing. In other words, what the company is right now. Operations is traditional.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Strategy, tactics, and operations are the components that describe the constant fluctuations of an organisation.</p>
            <p>The three components are depicted as Venn diagram in the following figure. As you see, they overlap. The intersection of strategy/tactics, strategy/operations, and tactics/operations is where the real power of APIs are.</p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/critical-design-thinking.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/critical-design-thinking.png"/></a></p>
            <p>It’s important to standardise processes to optimise them with respect to time, cost, and quality. When you standardise processes, you can define meaningful metrics, start measuring, and monitor KPIs.<br>
                Naturally, every organisation runs into business problems, which needs to be solved. To this goal, organisations typically apply <strong>critical thinking</strong> to solve business problems.<br>
                <strong>Critical thinking is the objective analysis of facts to form a judgement</strong><br>
                Hence, critical thinking is appropriate to solve business processes because you can analyse them and evaluate KPIs to make fact-based decision about what to improve or change.
            </p>
            <p><strong>An API solution</strong> consists of one or several APIs that solve an integration problem. More specifically, an API solution is an integration solution between computer systems to enable inter-communication.</p>
            <p>API solutions prospers within operations or the What-Is. The reasons are that the problems to solve are precise and the outcome measurable. Typical problems are integration of two computer systems or automation of business process X to improve speed and reduce costs.</p>
            <p>An API solution enables the automation of the interaction between computer systems. Automation may reduce significantly manual efforts and thus making processes cheaper and faster. Automation requires standardisation, which fosters higher quality.</p>
            <p><strong>An API product</strong> consists of one or several APIs that provide an interface to a value proposition. In other words, an API product consists of value proposition interfaces or rather VPIs. In contrast, API solutions consists of API, which don’t provide an interface to a value proposition. The value proposition of API solutions is creating the communication link between computer systems.</p>
            <p>API products help customers getting the job done. To this goal, API products address customer pains and offer gains. API products have a business model and thus creating value for both the organisation and its customers.<br>
                API products prospers within tactics or the What-Will-Be. The reasons are that the problems to solve are precise and the outcome measurable. Typical goal is to explore and find new business models thus, impacting the strategy it self. This is digital transformation in its core.

            <p>Organisations use <strong>Business Process Modeling (BP Modeling)</strong> in order to visually document, understand, and improve their processes. A part of <strong>Business Process Management (BPM)</strong>, 
                BP Modeling has been used as an organisational tool to <strong>map out what is (or “as-is”) as a baseline</strong> and to <strong>determine the future (or “to-be”) with any improvements assimilated</strong>. BP Modeling visually represents all of the connecting activities, events, and resources of the process of a product or service to make it more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>Process modeling often uses <strong>Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)</strong>, a standard method of illustrating processes with flowchart-like diagrams that can be easily understood by both IT and business managers.</p>
            <p>Reasons to use BP Modeling are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>to create visual models of processes</strong> - Word-driven documentation is often not sufficient for employees to understand the way a process is performed. Backing it up with visual representations helps provide a comprehensive picture</li>
                <li><strong>align operations</strong> - With any new business strategy, keeping processes consistent after a change requires figuring out how to stay within the overall organizational strategy. Analyses are also performed to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and enable process agility</li>
                <li><strong>improve process communication </strong>- Communication is the key to all of the following tasks: formalizing existing processes (that were once informal knowledge), making consistent processes, eliminating guesswork with business rules, handling exceptions, providing regulatory compliance, ensuring business people are in charge, and supporting new initiatives</li>
                <li><strong>improve operational efficiency </strong>- Modeling processes promotes optimization by allowing simulation and illustrating needed improvements. This reduces cycle time and promotes better resource utilisation</li>
                <li><strong>gain competitive advantage </strong>- A process is better overall when it is constantly refined and aligned with its business’ strategies. This efficiency places the company in a forward-leaning position to be better than the competition</li>

            <h3>Procurement</h3>
            <p>This is the process of finding, agreeing terms and acquiring goods, services or works from an external source, often via a tendering or competitive bidding process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services or works at the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared. Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimising risk, such as exposure to fraud and collusion.</p>

            <p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-strategy-bcaa3fda9a31"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WTF is Strategy?</strong></a></p>
            <p><strong>The framework: </strong>before we talk about strategy, it needs to be contextualized within a few other concepts primarily because strategy never exists (or shouldn’t exist) in isolation. Here are the high-level definitions of the different components from a product-centric view:</p>
            <uL>
                <li><strong>Mission:</strong> This is a statement that describes the problem you are setting out to solve, typically including who you are solving it for. This is often set at the company level, but can also be defined for a product or product line.</li>
                <li><strong>Vision:</strong> This is the idealized solution that addresses the problem you’ve articulated in your mission. A product vision typically has just enough viability to be relatable, but is still devoid of the details that may hamper your imagination. Product vision is also the goal post and rallying point for your product — it paints the picture of how your product will make an impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a set of principles and decisions — informed by reality (e.g. market forces, laws of physics, data) and caveated with assumptions — that you commit to ahead of development to ensure the greatest likelihood of success in achieving your vision. Your strategy may evolve with the introduction of new data. If there’s a big shift in strategy while the mission and vision remain constant, it’s called a <strong>pivot</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Roadmap:</strong> This is the manifestation of your strategy in concrete steps towards your product vision, inclusive of rough milestones and timelines. This, too, often changes given new data. (As I like to say, a roadmap is defunct as soon as it’s published.)</li>
                <li><strong>Execution:</strong> This is the day-to-day activities along the path of the roadmap. This is where you do the hard work to build, launch, and iterate, all the while collecting the necessary data to inform any changes in your roadmap and strategy.</li>
            </uL>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/strategy1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/tech/strategy1.png"/></a></p>
            <p>As the gradient and size of the diagram above suggests, the mission, by design, is both vague and broad. The further down you go in the stack, the more concrete and narrow these concepts become.</p>
            <p>Strategy within this framework bridges the gap between <strong>what you aspire to be</strong> and <strong>what you are doing.</strong></p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/strategy2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/strategy2.png"/></a></p>
            <p>In other words, <strong>strategy represents the set of guiding principles for your roadmapping and execution tasks to ensure they align with your mission and vision.</strong></p>

            <p>Most applications have an API or presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data layer</p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/UATpyramid.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/tech/UATpyramid.png"/></a></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>unit tests</strong>: they cover a very small amount of code</li>
                <li><strong>integration tests:</strong> cover multiple modules in the system for compliance</li>
                <li><strong>acceptance tests</strong>: cover the system for high level compliance, is it ready to deliver?</li>
                <li><strong>UI tests</strong>: enter through the UI and test a specific flow</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Acceptance testing </strong>is about checking that the system as a whole behaves as it should. One acceptance tests might go end to end but it will still not cover the entire system but just one specific scenario: given a set of inputs, do I get these outputs. Instead you want to have a suit of acceptances suit that covers all the behaviours you care about.</p>
            <p><strong>Why writing acceptance tests:</strong> repeatable, gives confidence, les maintenance cost and less risk and fear.<br>
                When developing code they prevent you from doing too much regressions, offer guardrails, and is good for bug fixing.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Format of an acceptance test: </strong><br>
            set up (the data),<br>
            invoke,<br> 
            verify (the result) and <br>
            clean up (clear the data from the DB -from the set up)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3 essential steps with a slightly different name:</strong><br>
                Arrange ==  set up<br>
                Act == invoke<br>
                Assert == verify
            </p>
            <p>Every test should be clear, simple and if you can't write a simple test than the code probably need to be simplified (code smell detector)</p>
            <p class="lead">Red Green Refactor loop:</p>
            <p>
                write a red (a failing test = an expected behaviour that your system is failing to provide just now)<br>
                needs to fail for the right reason (test for the right thing)<br>
                write the green (write the code so the test pass, code should be simple)<br>
                once it works, you can refactor (= changing the structure of the code but not the functionality), <br>
                code should be cleaner and more extensible, then test the code again, it should pass.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>write a failed acceptance test for a use case that is not yet implemented</li>
                <li>implement each smaller piece with TDD </li>
                <li>repeat 2 ( implementing a small piece) until the acceptance test 1 passes</li>
                <li>repeat 1 to 3 until the feature is complete</li>
                <li>change UI to use new API feature</li>
            </ol>
            <p>At the end of a stage, if you have added value without removing any then you can ship!<br>
                when you release a code where the functionality is there but the user can't access it yet (UI not done yet), it's called: a <strong>dark release.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>By writing the test first, you are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>forced to decide the shape and function of endpoints before they exist</li>
                <li>helps you determine what constitutes a slice of value</li>
                <li>signals when the feature is ready to ship (even if dark release)</li>
                <li>gives you confidence the piece of value is complete</li>
            </ul>
