            <p>As citizens experimented with the app’s features, they were able to stay in touch with io’s development team to report bugs and errors, provide feedback on the app’s operation and make constructive suggestions.</p>
            <p>This resulted in an extremely valuable flow of information for us: people using the app are generally enthusiastic and satisfied with how it works, proving that the app really does meet their needs. The majority of bugs have surfaced, which ensures the release of a much more solid version of the io app, later this year.</p>
            <p>The truly extraordinary thing, however, was that our roadmap evolved during these months of testing, thanks to citizen feedback. This is a radical paradigm shift: <strong>citizens are telling us what to work on, what features to develop, how to improve the app to better suit their needs</strong>.</p>

            <p>By making people partners in services, we can make those services more human. This is the right thing to do and, crucially, makes services more effective. Our challenge is to find ways to do this on a community-wide scale.</p>
            <p>When we take this approach to a systematic level it discourages the individual and the community from counting on their own strengths and capabilities.</p>
            <p>The <strong>‘relational approach’</strong> is based on the principle that humans are cooperative and collaborative and that if we can create the structures that facilitate this behaviour then we can create a better society.</p>
            <p>Using neighbourhoods as the unit of change, experimenting with relational approaches, and focusing on strength-based service models. </p>
            <p>While asset-based relational approaches may appear jargon-heavy, the principles are simple: services should be developed on the basis that ‘nothing for us or about us should be done without us’.</p>
            <p>By stimulating what is already working, we encourage a system-wide approach to increasing physical activity in the borough that has designed itself to be unique to the individual needs of the diverse community it serves.</p>
            <p>For Service Designers, this requires a radical shift in mindset from problems and needs to strengths and assets.</p>

            <p>Three key components of a community of practice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the domain as “an identity defined by a shared domain of interest. Membership therefore implies a commitment to the domain, and therefore a shared competence that distinguishes members from other people”</li>
                <li>the community as the pursuit of the community’s “interest in their domain” (op. cit.) and the relational space that leads to trust building — oftentimes through interactions that span the personal and the professional</li>
                <li>the practice as the “shared repertoire of resources: experiences, stories, tools, ways of addressing recurring problems — in short a shared practice. This takes time and sustained interaction"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What does success look like when we design learning experiences that centre communities of practice?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary focus on relationships and trust building rather than on ‘knowledge transfer’</li>
                <li>Coaches need coaches too. Keeping the flame alive takes time and energy and CoP stewards and facilitators also need support and nourishment to keep going</li>
                <li>Design for ecosystem learning outcomes. There’s a need to think about the long-term journey of a community (emergent as it is!) and the role of a specific learning experience in the wider domain</li>
                <li>Centre equity in the funding model. This is a big sticking point and experimental ground for me, as many learning offers come with a prohibitive cost. This usually reflects the amount of time, care and creative process that’s required to design and facilitate, while highlighting the lack of core funding to cover this.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>On Culture: </strong><br>
              Traditionally, we think of culture as a set of values that orient society. But in cultural sociology there has been a movement towards thinking about culture as the many ways people process and make sense of the world around them.</p>
            <p><strong>On bias:</strong><br>
              As humans, we're hardwired to be biased. It’s a survival mechanism that allows us to process a lot of information very quickly.<br>
              However, as researchers in the social sector, we need to be really careful about biases like out-group homogeneity bias and the fundamental attribution error. When we do research in multicultural settings or with disadvantaged populations, these biases can limit our ability to identify important intra-group differences and relevant contextual factors.<br>
              That’s why homogeneity in the design industry is such a problem. It makes us more susceptible to these biases.
            </p>  
            <p><strong>Cognitive Empathy:</strong><br>
              One of the cornerstones of any good qualitative research is cognitive empathy, which is the ability to understand another person's situation through their own perspective. In design, we use tools like personas and empathy maps to facilitate that perspective-taking.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Complex issues:</strong><br>
              But problems in the social sector are complex. Although our users are experts in their personal user journey, they don’t necessarily know why the barriers they face exist. That’s why it’s so important that we reference subject matter experts like community advocates, journalists, and scholars throughout the design process. They provide an invaluable systems-level view of the silent actors and processes that shape users’ experiences.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Moving from service design to policy design:</strong><br>
              I've noticed that design teams in the social sector are moving away from product design and moving towards service design. I think the next big shift is going to be from service design to policy design.<br>
But the question will be, as always, who gets to frame the policy problem and whose expertise is weighted in the design of the solution?<br>
That’s why I want design in the social sector to move towards what I like to think of as community-driven and justice-oriented design. As researchers, we should support community autonomy and capacity building.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Informed consent:</strong><br>
              Let’s take informed consent, which is one of the foundations of European-American research ethics. Researchers must disclose enough information to potential participants so that they feel comfortable about joining a study.<br>
              Design teams often ask “how can we increase user trust and gain access?” But I think the more important question is “why should users trust us and grant access?” By default we assume our presence in disadvantaged communities is necessary.<br>
              Lately, I’ve been reading the work of anthropologist Kim TallBear who studies how indigenous communities exercise power and self-determination by refusing to participate in research.<br>
              So it got me thinking: what if in our interactions with communities we reframe consent as something they can strategically withhold rather than something they sign away?<br>
              In practice, this could take many forms. We could draft granular consent forms. We could design data repositories where research participants could delete their data ad hoc. We could work with community leaders and host townhalls about consent and data privacy. We could even develop accountability boards.

           <p>DARVO is a manipulative tactic abusers and harassers employ to avoid being held accountable. It's very simple, but it often works—until people become aware of it. Because once you know how to spot DARVO, you're a lot less likely to fall for it. </p>
           <ul>
            <li><strong>Deny</strong>: First, the accused party attempts to convince the person harmed, or bystanders, that the harm never happened. This is a type of gaslighting: trying to make people distrust themselves and their sense of reality</li>
            <li><strong>Attack</strong>: Once the victim or bystander is destabilized, the accused party then goes into attack mode, claiming that *the other party* did something wrong. Perhaps the accused party calls the harmed person bitter. Or says they have an axe to grind. Maybe accuses them of being erratic, crazy</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse Victim and Offender</strong>: Now the accused party attempts to position themselves as the wronged party—the victim of the woke mob / PC warriors / petty vendettas. Their goal is to shift focus away from the harm they caused, and toward the *hurt* it's caused them to be called out for that harm. If they're successful, they'll convince others that they're the real victim here. </li>

            <p>A narrow focus on the design of services does not account for the invisible systemic relationships and interdependencides that need to be transformed to realise long-term change.</p>
            <p>Underlying assumptions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The value of design is its outputs</li>
                no the value is its process
                <li>Design is an activity done by a few</li>
                design is a fundamental aspect of all social life
                <li>design is a congitive process</li>
                design is an embodied experience
                <li>social structures are an externality of the design</li>
                no they are the material of the design
                <li>actors are seperate from the systems they design</li>
                no they are entangled in the systems they design
                <li>design is politically neutral</li>
                no it's inherently political'
            </ol>
            <p>Service design is a process of shaping social structures</p>

            <p><em>"If a factory is torn down but the rationality which producted it is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroy the systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced this government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding government. There is so much talk about the system. And so little understanding." - Robert M. Pirsig Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance 1974</em></p>
