        <p>Mark Forsyth quote: "[Adjectives] in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac. It’s an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out. And as size comes before colour, green great dragons can’t exist."</p>

        <p>UX writing is the practice of crafting UI copy that guides users within a product and helps them interact with it. UI copy includes buttons and menu labels, error messages, security notes, terms and conditions, as well as any instructions on product usage.<br>
            The primary aim of UX writing is to settle communication between users and a digital product.</p>
        <p><strong>Work on text early because text problems often reveal design problems.</strong><br>
            If a team has trouble explaining a design, quite often it is the design, not the text copy, that needs improving.</p>
        <p>Tips On Writing UI Text</p>
        <ul>
            <li>be concise</li>
            <li>avoid long blocks of text</li>
            <li>avoid double negatives</li>
            <li>begin with the objective</li>
            <li>use specific verbs whenever possible</li>
            <li>make the copy consistent</li>
            <li>avoid jargon</li>
            <li>write in present tense</li>
            <li>write in the active voice</li>
            <li>Use numerals (number instead of their text version)</li>
            <li>avoid showing all details up front (progressive disclosure is especially good for mobile UI)</li>
            <li>identify interactive elements appropriately</li>
            <li>be careful when using humor</li>
            <li>use language that’s consistent with the user’s platform</li>
            <li>use ‘today,’ ‘yesterday’ or ‘tomorrow’ instead of a date</li>
            <li>use graphics if they will help you communicate</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead"></strong> Goals in your research:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>what do people want to do</li>

        <p><strong>Content design is a way of thinking, it's about using data and evidence to give an audience:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>what they need</li>
            <li>at the time that they need it</li>
            <li>and in a way they expect</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p><strong>Crit</strong>: short nickname for content critique</p>
        <ul>
            <li>no set rules for how often you do crits</li>
            <li>doing it early in the process stops people getting too attached to their copy before it's improved and helps everyone to be confident that they are heading in the right direction</li>
            <li>you don't have to wait until after pair writing - you can do a crit at any stage of the process</li>
            <li>take turn to be the note-taker</li>
            <li>critique is not criticism. If content designers end up defending their work, the environment is wrong. Keep crits focused on making the product better</li>
            <li>you don't have to take all the suggestions on board.Trust is needed that the content designer know what they are doing</li>

        <p><strong>Happy talk must die</strong>: we all know happy talk when we see it: it's the introductory text that's supposed to welcome us to the site and tell us how great it is, or to tell us what we're about to see in the section we've just entered. Happy talk is like small talk - content free, basically just a way to be sociable. but most Web users don't have time for small talk: they want to get rigth to the beef. You can, and you should - eliminate as much happy talk as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Instructions must die</strong>: Your objective should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self explanatory or as close to it as possible. When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to the bare minimum.</p>

        <p>To stand out on a result page, you need 3 things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>push and pull content</li>
            <li>trust</li>
            <li>ease of use</li>
        </ul>
        <p>you need to find:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the vocabulary your audience is using</li>
            <li>what they want to know most (so you can prioritise</li>
            <li>their mental models (how they thinks)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With metrics and analytics you can see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how many people visit a page</li>
            <li>how quickly people leave</li>
            <li>most popular links on the page</li>
            <li>time people spend on a page</li>
            <li>search terms used on that page</li>
            <li>where they came from (referrals)</li>
            <li>where they go to</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Be careful with <strong>bounce rate</strong>: it can mean someone landing on a page, not clicking on any of the links and leaving. Some count a bounce as someone arriving at a page and leaving in under 10 seconds. when looking at your data, bounce rate can help spot pages that aren't working effectively, but a high bounce rate cane also mean a page is working well!</p>
        <p><strong>Time on a page</strong>: this refers to how long a particular reader spends on a particular page. It might be seconds, or minutes. Like the bounce rate, you'll have to make an editorial judgment on whether time on a page is successful or not based on what the page is trying to do. If it's a page with a lot of text that you want people to read then higher time numbers are good. But if the page has a single call to action that most people should skip through, then high numbers are a warning sign that something is wrong with the page.</p>
        <p><strong>Headings</strong> are very important. I'ts the first thing your audience will see in the search results, so make them targeted and relevant. They are what will pull your audience to your site from search or, if already on the website, it will tell them they are in the right place.</p>
        <p><strong>Front-loading</strong>: putting the most important word(s) of the sentence at the beginning. If you frontload your headings, you make it easier and quicker for readers to understand the content.</p>

        <p>This particular message in the design system is a general message based on how something was validated in the service I worked on and we did not have a choice about how that happened. When we tested this people could always work out what had gone wrong and fix the problem.<br>
            Separate error messages, like 'Date of birth must include a day' and 'Date of birth must include a day and month', would be more helpful. It would make people validate a date in a specific way. We can add some more specific ones to the page. How is this?<br>

                #### If an incomplete date is entered and you know what is missing<br>
                Say ‘[whatever it is] must include a [whatever is missing]’.<br>
                For example, ‘Date of birth must include a month’ or ‘Date of birth must include a day and month’.<br>
                <br>
                 #### If an incomplete date is entered and you do not know what is missing<br>

        <p>Discussion from UKgov Slack: recommend Arial/Helvetica for non govuk service because most people have these fiont, so they don't need to be downloaded, making it faster. They are also clear fonts</p>

        <p class="lead">From The non-Designer Design Book:</p>
        <p><strong>Kerning</strong> is the process of removing tiny units of space between characters to create visually consistent letter spacing</p>     
        <p><strong>Widow</strong>: when the last line of a paragraph has fewer than seven (more or less depending on the length of the line) characters, that last line is a widow. Worse than leaving one word as the last line is leaving part of a word. Don't ever do that.</p>  
        <p><strong>Orphan</strong>: when the last line of a paragraph, be it ever so long, ends at the top of the next column or page all by itself.</p>

        <p class="lead"><a href="https://twitter.com/dandoescontent/status/1239248978060939265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thread on font weight</a></p>
        <p>The thickness of font characters is measured in weight. 400 is considered 'regular' and 700+ is considered 'bold'.<br>
        A weight below 400 ('light' fonts) introduces more negative space to a block of text, whereas 400 or above ('bold' fonts) introduces more positive space.<br>
        I can't find the source now, but I once read that an increase of either positive or negative space causes a user's eye movements when reading (saccades) to slow down. As such, excessively light or bold text takes more effort - both physically and cognitively - to read.<br>
        Mixing up your font weight is an effective way to draw attention to particular words or phrases, but consider that what you draw attention to won't necessarily be easy to read.<br>
        The classic case for using bold is of course "to emphasise important points for the user."<br>
        I've never felt particularly comfortable with this as it seems to me that, if you need to draw attention to something, you have a lot of redundant content that could be cut.<br>
        There are people who work in typesetting who know a lot more about this than me.<br>
        My 2 pence: use light or heavy fonts with caution and as a last resort. Consider first whether there might be better ways to ensure that users can find the info they need.<br>
        This of course doesn't address it from an accessibility angle and is also related to my tweet above re having redundant content.<br>
        Using &lt;strong&gt; (or &lt;b&gt;) to catch the eye of a sighted user does not make that word or phrase easier to find for users of assistive tech.<br>
        Additionally, many editors use bold to highlight content for visual effect that cannot accurately be reproduced for users of AT.<br>
        Screen readers make no distinction of text in &lt;b&gt; and they usually announce &lt;strong&gt; with a more urgent intonation which may not be appropriate.

        <p>Information architecture design for mobile doesn’t differ dramatically from information architecture design for the desktop. It’s important to research what’s useful on the mobile platform to your users and to try to keep things as simple and manageable as possible. This is true for both the IA and the navigation which directs the user through the IA.</p>
        <p>Handling content on mobile doesn’t need to be a chore but it does take planning.</p>
        <p>In general terms the way you design information architecture (IA) for the mobile environment is very similar to the way that you design the IA for the desktop. The approach you use is near identical in fact but there are some important things to bear in mind when you do so:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>deliver what’s important on the mobile platform: </strong>focus on what’s important to the user when they’re using a smartphone. That doesn’t mean that your users will necessarily be using your app when they’re on the move or on the street – you need to research the way that they will use the app. That, in turn, lets you focus on the content that’s of value to the user and cut down the volume of data that you present on mobile.</li>
            <li><strong>content should be focused on mobile :</strong>  that’s smaller, simpler and easier to handle content than on the desktop. The limit of screen real estate makes large volumes of content more confusing on mobile than on a larger monitor.</li>
            <li><strong>navigation should be simple: </strong>that means limiting the number of menu options and keeping things focused on what’s important to the user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then follow a simple process: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>consider click investment: minimum number of clicks is used to reach the most popular content. Less popular content can be farther away but not too far away. You can reduce levels of frustration with click investment by ensuring that you communicate the process clearly throughout the task</li>
            <li>Keep it simple Stupid (KISS) The simpler things are – the fewer issues with the overall experience. Keep categories to a minimum, keep content and categories together, keep links to a sensible number too, prioritise by popularity, label navigation items clearly and consisely</li>
            <li>think about input devices (for example  0 to 9 as shortcut keys will be better than 1 to 10 as it match the numeric keys on the phone</li>
            <li>provide clear navigational cues (back button, labels etc..</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead"><a href="https://medium.com/@ThatAlexPalmer/ux-design-process-maps-paths-signs-and-magic-a8008b884d8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UX Design Process — Maps, Paths, Signs, and Magic</strong></a></p>
        <p><strong>You can think of IA as the map, UX as the path along that map, and UI as the road signs along that path</strong></p>
        <p>When people use your app or website, they should always be able to answer five questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Where am I?</li>
            <li>What can I do here?</li>
            <li>How do I do it?</li>
            <li>How did I get here?</li>
            <li>Where can I go from here?</li>
            <li>IA, UX, and UI all work together to help people answer those questions quickly and easily. We’ll see how that works in practice later</li>
        </ol>    
        <p>Broadly speaking, <strong>IA is about categorising, organizing, and structuring information (or content) for both users and the application</strong>. All content within an app should be useful and valuable to its users. To find the useful and the valuable, IA/UX designers start with categorizing all existing and planned content, in the order we think it should be listed. We start with two assumptions: “most important to users” and “least important to users.” How do we know if our assumptions are correct? We don’t, unless we ask actual or potential users!</p>
        <p>When we start discovering what matters most to users, we can move on to the next step: a card sorting test that uncovers users’ mental models. The purpose of the test is to figure out how people think about your product or service, in their own words.</p>
        <p>Now that we have a better understanding of the users’ mental models, we can move on to discovering potential UX flows. A UX flow is how people go from having a task to getting that task done.</p>

        <p class ="lead">Steve Krug - Don't make me think</p>
        <p>When you enter a website, you are usually trying to find something. You decide whether to ask first (use the search functionality) or browse first. Some people (Jakob Nielsen calls them <strong>"search-dominant" users</strong> will always look for a search box as soon as they enter a site). Other people (Nielsen's <strong>"link-dominant" users</strong> will almost always browse first, searching only when they run out of likely links to click or when they have gotten sufficiently frustrated by the site.</p>
        <p>The web epxerience is missing many of the cues we've relied on all our lives to negociate spaces. Consider these oddities of Web space:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No sense of scale</strong>: even after we've used a website extensively, unless it's a very small site, we tend to have very little sense of how big it is (50 pages? 1000?). For all we know, there could be huge corners we've never explored. Compare this to a magazine, a museum, or a department store, where you always have at least a rough sense of the seen/unseen ratio.<br>
            The practical result is that's it's hard to know when to stop looking.</li>
            <li><strong>No sense of direction</strong>: in a website, there's no left or right, no up and down. We may talk about moving up and down, but we mean up and down in the hierarchy - to a more general or more specific level</li>
            <li><strong>No sense of location</strong>: in physical spaces, as we move around, we accumulate knowledge about the space. We develop a sense of where things are and can take shortcuts to get to them. When we want to return to something on a website, instead of relying on a physical sense of where it is, we have to remember where it is in the conceptual hierarchy and retrace our steps.<br>
            This is why <strong>bookmarks</strong> are so important and why the <strong>back button</strong> accounts for somewhere between 30 and 40% of all web clicks. (source is from 1995...). This also explains why the concept of <strong>Homepage</strong> is important. They are fixed places, Being able to click Home gives you a fresh start.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Purposes of navigation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>help to find whatever it is we're looking for</li>
            <li>tell us where we are</li>
            <li>gives something to hold on to</li>
            <li>tells us what's here</li>
            <li>tells us how to use the website</li>
            <li>give us confidence in the people who built it</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Persistent navigation (or global navigation)</strong> = navigation that appears on every page. It should include 5 elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a site ID (will serve as link to homepage too</li>
            <li>a way Home = this is crucial, no matter how lost I mayb get, I can always start over</li>
            <li>a way to search = unless the website is very small, you need it</li>
            <li>utilities = links to important elements of the website that aren't really part of the content hierarchy</li>
            <li>sections = primary navigation (links to the mains sections, this is the top level of the site's hierarchy</li>

        <h2>Information scent</h2>
        <p><strong>Following the Information Scent</strong></p>
        <p>When navigating through the virtual world, people display a similar approach to information gathering as they do in the physical world. The information search process is often referred to as <strong>'foraging'</strong> or following the <strong>'information scent'</strong>. The information foraging theory was developed by Stuart Card and Peter Pirolli; at the core of their proposal was the belief that web user behaviour is representative of the information gathering approach adopted by our ancestors when <strong>hunting for food</strong>.<br>
            They emphasise the role of web designers in helping lead users to their desired end-point by increasing the strength of scent for information related to their goals, whilst reducing the scent of unrelated, competing information.<br>
            Whilst hunting for prey, our ancestors needed to ensure the <strong>maximum haul for the minimum energy expenditure</strong>. This requirement led to the development of hunting strategies that were, more often than not, likely to succeed.<br>
            The similarity between the strategising of hunter-gatherers, who were omnivores, and that shown by web users has seen the generation of the term <strong>"Informavores"</strong>, which describes their appetite for information and disregard for anything that does not support their current aims.<br>            
            In the same way an animal sniffs the air to trace the scent of potential prey, users rely on various cues to lead them to their goal. To ensure time and effort are conserved, the user follows cues, either until they reach their goal or, when the strength of the scent gradually weakens, they seek an alternative scent.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">A summary of web users' foraging behaviour</p>
        <p>To summarise the information foraging behaviour displayed by web users:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>they arrive at the homepage, or another page deeper in a site after following a link</li>
            <li>they search for obvious cues to determine whether the information they seek is on the site and to guide their next step if there is a significantly strong scent</li>
            <li>if there are no strongly scented cues the user will likely abandon the site</li>
            <li>if there is a strong cue(s) the user will follow this path</li>
            <li>if the scent gets weaker as they follow the cues they might seek an alternative path, which could involve back steps to reach their starting point</li>
            <li>alternatively, the user might abandon the site at any one point along the search process if the effort and time expended seems unreasonable</li>
            <li>at each stage the user performs an instant evaluation to determine whether the strength of the information scent is sufficient for them to continue. This is the heart of information foraging behaviour; the user is constantly seeking to maximise pay-out for the minimum expenditure</li>
            <li>if at each stage the scent gets stronger the user will almost certainly continue on this path</li>
            <li>if the number of steps is not excessive the user should now reach their desired point. However, if the search process is a lengthy one, even if the scent gets progressively stronger, the user may still cease following an information scent</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead">Design solution</p>
        <p>Therefore, there are lots of different ways to lead the user along their desired goal path, but there are also many ways to crush their confidence in the information scent. To ensure the user does not lose confidence or patience, it is important to provide informative links that are clearly visible at the appropriate stage of a task. For example, when a user is navigating an eCommerce site they will need ready access to their shopping basket at all times, so they can determine how many items they have, which items they have and how much they will cost individually and in total. Also when they are reading product information the "Buy" button should be prominent, so the user does not have to invest any extra time or effort before they can make a purchase.</p>
        
        <p class="lead">Don't make me think - Steve Krug:</p>
        <p>"The number of clicks to get anywhere" seems like a useful criteria. But over time, I've come to think that waht really counts is not the number of clicks it takes me to get to what I want (although there are limits), but rather how hard each click is - the amount of thought required, and the amount of uncertainty about whether I'm making the right choice.</p>
        <p>In general, I think it's safe to say that users don't mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they're on the right track - following what Jared spool calls "the scent of information." I think the rule of thumb might be something like <strong>3 mindless, unambiguous clicks = 1 click that requires thought.</strong></p>

        <p>A content model documents all the different types of content you will have for a given project. It contains detailed definitions of each content type’s elements and their relationships to each other.</p>
        <p>We can break this up into three parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>understanding what types of content you have</li>
            <li>analysing the parts each type is made up of</li>
            <li>defining how those parts relate to each other</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are just a few ways you can put content modelling to work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>analysing existing content</li>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>comprehension:</strong> all of the information is provided, but it is presented in a way that is not easy to understand. Examples might be on medication labels, or airline boarding passes</li>
            <li><strong>comparison</strong> lots of options presented in the design, but they are not organized in a way that helps the customer make a decision. Examples might be comparing healthcare options, finding a doctor, or attending a conference</li>
            <li><strong>causal relationships</strong> Interaction that allows customers to work through simulations to show cause and effect over time that reveal patterns and help them make better decisions. Some loose examples include exploring the cost of shipping during a checkout process, cost of living or mortgage calculations</li>
            <li><strong>discovery</strong> often with data visualizations, people don’t know the question they want answered. You might have some ideas but you don’t know what you’ll learn. Analytics can fall into this category, as some users won’t know what they want to track</li>
            <li><strong>relationships</strong> getting oriented to a space and understanding the relationships between different topics. Whenever we enter a new space, we are trying to orient ourselves to it. This example could include visual models like sitemaps, concept models or mind maps</li>
            <li><strong>practice</strong> we may understand the elements presented, but we really need to sit down and practice to get better at it</li>
            <li><strong>distributed Cognition</strong> the knowledge you need for understanding a thing is distributed across people, projects, devices, and environments. Ties into service design,could even extend to getting different devices to talk to one another</li>

        <p>Here are 10 ways to make your writing more accessible:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Left-align all your text. At the end of a line, the eye naturally tracks back to find the next one. Centre-alignment means you have to hunt for it. It’s much easier to read when it all lines up</li>
            <li>Be consistent with fonts. Changing fonts on the next line/heading/paragraph makes your words much harder to follow. Same goes for italics and underlining - use *bold* instead</li>
            <li>Use readable fonts. According to the British Dyslexia Association, sans-serif fonts make letters less crowded. Larger character spacing helps too</li>
            <li>Avoid Starting All Words With Uppercase Letters OR ALL CAPITALS. Lower case is far easier to read</li>
            <li>Size things logically. Start with bigger fonts for main headings and progressively get smaller. Don’t throw in a random big font at a strange place on the page. 16px/12pt is standard for body text but can vary depending on design. Check it on mobile and desktop. If in doubt, go bigger</li>
            <li>Break up big chunks of text. You can support the reader to navigate the text with subheadings, bullets, diagrams and images. Avoid columns as these can make focusing difficult</li>
            <li>Go light, not white. Single-colour pale backgrounds work best for visual contrast. White is particularly difficult for people with dyslexia. Avoid green/red tones which are hard for those with colour-blindness</li>
            <li>Use white space to declutter pages. Busy pages can be actively distressing to sensitive readers</li>
            <li>Explain jargon. Don’t assume your reader knows what you’re talking about – even if you consider them an “expert”. A glossary can really help</li>
            <li>Check your readability score using Flesch-Kincaid. The higher the number, the easier it is to read – particularly important if you have a wide audience. I recommend 60-70 for B2B, 70+ for everything else. If your score is below 60 and it’s not an academic paper, I suggest you shorten some sentences, chunk up long paragraphs and replace some of your polysyllabic words with simpler alternatives</li>

        <h2>White space</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The power of white space</strong></a></p>
        <p>White space (negative space) is the area between design elements. It's another tool for designers to design for the user experience (UX). Remember that white space is not necessarily white; it’s just the name to indicate spaces where there are neither user interface (UI) elements nor specific content.</p>
        <p>As a designer, you can introduce white space based on four main factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>content</li>
          <li>design</li>
          <li>user</li>
          <li>brand</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use <strong>macro white space</strong> to organize content in the layout and direct the user through the blocks of content shown. Use <strong>micro white space</strong> inside the design element features as seen in the text, images and content blocks.</p>
        <p>We can also approach white space as being <strong>passive or active</strong>. Passive white space does not have a specific role in the design other than facilitating the user experience. It is all about being easier to read. Active white space guides the focus and attention of users. It is more about standing out and making a statement.</p>

        <h2>Writing tips - From Sarah Richards</h2>
        <p>You probably have 3 seconds to get my attention, and 5 to keep it. so the first paragraph on a page is very very important. Make those 3 seconds count.</p>
        <p><strong>subheadings</strong>: they tell a story, it helps tell your audience in seconds exactly what information they are going to get. They break up the text and they help you remember and understand when the text is complex and long</p>
        <p><strong>Bullet points</strong>: they break things up, make the page less dense, make the text quicker to read</p>
        <p><strong>Keep sentences short</strong> about 15 to 20 words.</p>
        <p><strong>Jargon</strong>: introduce the word first. Writing to understand quickly has nothing to do with intelligent, it has a lot to do with time and respect.</p>
        <p><strong>The average reading age in the UK is about 9 years old.</strong> An average 9 years old has over 30,000 terms in their vocabulary. Writing for an age range isn't the same as writing to that age. Most 9 years old won't be interested in insurance. But someone who is 49 with little time or dyslexia or has a small phone screen or a life to live will benefit from you getting to the point quickly and with little jargon.<br>
        <strong>It's not dumbing down, it's opening up.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Respect your audience:</strong> if you write clearly with good structure, short sentences and plain language, you are helping people read. In the UK alone, this means you may be helping:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 million people who have a learning disability</li>
            <li>7 million people who have dyslexia</li>
            <li>2 million people with a visual impairment</li>
            <li>lots of people using a poor internet connection</li>
            <li>most people who don't want to read and reread something just to understand it</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This is not about perceived intelligence - it's about speed of reading anf comprehension. Nothing else.</strong></p>
