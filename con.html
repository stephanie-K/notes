        <p>UX writing is the practice of crafting UI copy that guides users within a product and helps them interact with it. UI copy includes buttons and menu labels, error messages, security notes, terms and conditions, as well as any instructions on product usage.<br>
            The primary aim of UX writing is to settle communication between users and a digital product.</p>
        <p><strong>Work on text early because text problems often reveal design problems.</strong><br>
            If a team has trouble explaining a design, quite often it is the design, not the text copy, that needs improving.</p>
        <p>Tips On Writing UI Text</p>
        <ul>
            <li>be concise</li>
            <li>avoid long blocks of text</li>
            <li>avoid double negatives</li>
            <li>begin with the objective</li>
            <li>use specific verbs whenever possible</li>
            <li>make the copy consistent</li>
            <li>avoid jargon</li>
            <li>write in present tense</li>
            <li>write in the active voice</li>
            <li>Use numerals (number instead of their text version)</li>
            <li>avoid showing all details up front (progressive disclosure is especially good for mobile UI)</li>
            <li>identify interactive elements appropriately</li>
            <li>be careful when using humor</li>
            <li>use language that’s consistent with the user’s platform</li>
            <li>use ‘today,’ ‘yesterday’ or ‘tomorrow’ instead of a date</li>
            <li>use graphics if they will help you communicate</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead"></strong> Goals in your research:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>what do people want to do</li>

        <p>This particular message in the design system is a general message based on how something was validated in the service I worked on and we did not have a choice about how that happened. When we tested this people could always work out what had gone wrong and fix the problem.<br>
            Separate error messages, like 'Date of birth must include a day' and 'Date of birth must include a day and month', would be more helpful. It would make people validate a date in a specific way. We can add some more specific ones to the page. How is this?<br>
                <br>
                #### If an incomplete date is entered and you know what is missing<br>
                Say ‘[whatever it is] must include a [whatever is missing]’.<br>
                For example, ‘Date of birth must include a month’ or ‘Date of birth must include a day and month’.<br>
                <br>
                 #### If an incomplete date is entered and you do not know what is missing<br>
                Say ‘Enter [whatever it is] and include a day, month and year’.<br>

        <p>The craft of structuring, organising, and labelling information to make it easier to ﬁnd and understand.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-heart-of-the-matter-information-architecture-in-the-mobile-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Heart of the Matter, Information Architecture in the Mobile Age</strong></a></p>
        <p>Information architecture design for mobile doesn’t differ dramatically from information architecture design for the desktop. It’s important to research what’s useful on the mobile platform to your users and to try to keep things as simple and manageable as possible. This is true for both the IA and the navigation which directs the user through the IA.</p>
        <p>Handling content on mobile doesn’t need to be a chore but it does take planning.</p>
        <p>In general terms the way you design information architecture (IA) for the mobile environment is very similar to the way that you design the IA for the desktop. The approach you use is near identical in fact but there are some important things to bear in mind when you do so:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>deliver what’s important on the mobile platform: </strong>focus on what’s important to the user when they’re using a smartphone. That doesn’t mean that your users will necessarily be using your app when they’re on the move or on the street – you need to research the way that they will use the app. That, in turn, lets you focus on the content that’s of value to the user and cut down the volume of data that you present on mobile.</li>
            <li><strong>content should be focused on mobile :</strong>  that’s smaller, simpler and easier to handle content than on the desktop. The limit of screen real estate makes large volumes of content more confusing on mobile than on a larger monitor.</li>
            <li><strong>navigation should be simple: </strong>that means limiting the number of menu options and keeping things focused on what’s important to the user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then follow a simple process: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>consider click investment: minimum number of clicks is used to reach the most popular content. Less popular content can be farther away but not too far away. You can reduce levels of frustration with click investment by ensuring that you communicate the process clearly throughout the task</li>
            <li>Keep it simple Stupid (KISS) The simpler things are – the fewer issues with the overall experience. Keep categories to a minimum, keep content and categories together, keep links to a sensible number too, prioritise by popularity, label navigation items clearly and consisely</li>
            <li>think about input devices (for example  0 to 9 as shortcut keys will be better than 1 to 10 as it match the numeric keys on the phone</li>
            <li>provide clear navigational cues (back button, labels etc..</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead"><a href="https://medium.com/@ThatAlexPalmer/ux-design-process-maps-paths-signs-and-magic-a8008b884d8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UX Design Process — Maps, Paths, Signs, and Magic</strong></a></p>
        <p><strong>You can think of IA as the map, UX as the path along that map, and UI as the road signs along that path</strong></p>
        <p>When people use your app or website, they should always be able to answer five questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Where am I?</li>
            <li>What can I do here?</li>
            <li>How do I do it?</li>
            <li>How did I get here?</li>
            <li>Where can I go from here?</li>
            <li>IA, UX, and UI all work together to help people answer those questions quickly and easily. We’ll see how that works in practice later</li>
        </ol>    
        <p>Broadly speaking, <strong>IA is about categorising, organizing, and structuring information (or content) for both users and the application</strong>. All content within an app should be useful and valuable to its users. To find the useful and the valuable, IA/UX designers start with categorizing all existing and planned content, in the order we think it should be listed. We start with two assumptions: “most important to users” and “least important to users.” How do we know if our assumptions are correct? We don’t, unless we ask actual or potential users!</p>
        <p>When we start discovering what matters most to users, we can move on to the next step: a card sorting test that uncovers users’ mental models. The purpose of the test is to figure out how people think about your product or service, in their own words.</p>
        <p>Now that we have a better understanding of the users’ mental models, we can move on to discovering potential UX flows. A UX flow is how people go from having a task to getting that task done.</p>

        <h3>Information scent</h3>
        <p><strong>Following the Information Scent</strong></p>
        <p>When navigating through the virtual world, people display a similar approach to information gathering as they do in the physical world. The information search process is often referred to as <strong>'foraging'</strong> or following the <strong>'information scent'</strong>. The information foraging theory was developed by Stuart Card and Peter Pirolli; at the core of their proposal was the belief that web user behaviour is representative of the information gathering approach adopted by our ancestors when <strong>hunting for food</strong>.<br>
            They emphasise the role of web designers in helping lead users to their desired end-point by increasing the strength of scent for information related to their goals, whilst reducing the scent of unrelated, competing information.<br>
            Whilst hunting for prey, our ancestors needed to ensure the <strong>maximum haul for the minimum energy expenditure</strong>. This requirement led to the development of hunting strategies that were, more often than not, likely to succeed.<br>
            The similarity between the strategising of hunter-gatherers, who were omnivores, and that shown by web users has seen the generation of the term <strong>"Informavores"</strong>, which describes their appetite for information and disregard for anything that does not support their current aims.<br>            
            In the same way an animal sniffs the air to trace the scent of potential prey, users rely on various cues to lead them to their goal. To ensure time and effort are conserved, the user follows cues, either until they reach their goal or, when the strength of the scent gradually weakens, they seek an alternative scent.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">A summary of web users' foraging behaviour</p>
        <p>To summarise the information foraging behaviour displayed by web users:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>they arrive at the homepage, or another page deeper in a site after following a link</li>
            <li>they search for obvious cues to determine whether the information they seek is on the site and to guide their next step if there is a significantly strong scent</li>
            <li>if there are no strongly scented cues the user will likely abandon the site</li>
            <li>if there is a strong cue(s) the user will follow this path</li>
            <li>if the scent gets weaker as they follow the cues they might seek an alternative path, which could involve back steps to reach their starting point</li>
            <li>alternatively, the user might abandon the site at any one point along the search process if the effort and time expended seems unreasonable</li>
            <li>at each stage the user performs an instant evaluation to determine whether the strength of the information scent is sufficient for them to continue. This is the heart of information foraging behaviour; the user is constantly seeking to maximise pay-out for the minimum expenditure</li>
            <li>if at each stage the scent gets stronger the user will almost certainly continue on this path</li>
            <li>if the number of steps is not excessive the user should now reach their desired point. However, if the search process is a lengthy one, even if the scent gets progressively stronger, the user may still cease following an information scent</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead">Design solution</p>
        <p>Therefore, there are lots of different ways to lead the user along their desired goal path, but there are also many ways to crush their confidence in the information scent. To ensure the user does not lose confidence or patience, it is important to provide informative links that are clearly visible at the appropriate stage of a task. For example, when a user is navigating an eCommerce site they will need ready access to their shopping basket at all times, so they can determine how many items they have, which items they have and how much they will cost individually and in total. Also when they are reading product information the "Buy" button should be prominent, so the user does not have to invest any extra time or effort before they can make a purchase.</p>

        <p>The optimum line length for websites is generally accepted as between <strong>50-60 characters long</strong>, equating to typically between <strong>10 and 15 words</strong>. Using columns with a capped width will enable greater readability for all users.</p>

        <p>A content model documents all the different types of content you will have for a given project. It contains detailed definitions of each content type’s elements and their relationships to each other.</p>
        <p>We can break this up into three parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>understanding what types of content you have</li>
            <li>analysing the parts each type is made up of</li>
            <li>defining how those parts relate to each other</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are just a few ways you can put content modelling to work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>analysing existing content</li>
            <li>communicating with designers</li>
            <li>guiding authors</li>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>comprehension:</strong> all of the information is provided, but it is presented in a way that is not easy to understand. Examples might be on medication labels, or airline boarding passes</li>
            <li><strong>comparison</strong> lots of options presented in the design, but they are not organized in a way that helps the customer make a decision. Examples might be comparing healthcare options, finding a doctor, or attending a conference</li>
            <li><strong>causal relationships</strong> Interaction that allows customers to work through simulations to show cause and effect over time that reveal patterns and help them make better decisions. Some loose examples include exploring the cost of shipping during a checkout process, cost of living or mortgage calculations</li>
            <li><strong>discovery</strong> often with data visualizations, people don’t know the question they want answered. You might have some ideas but you don’t know what you’ll learn. Analytics can fall into this category, as some users won’t know what they want to track</li>
            <li><strong>relationships</strong> getting oriented to a space and understanding the relationships between different topics. Whenever we enter a new space, we are trying to orient ourselves to it. This example could include visual models like sitemaps, concept models or mind maps</li>
            <li><strong>practice</strong> we may understand the elements presented, but we really need to sit down and practice to get better at it</li>
            <li><strong>distributed Cognition</strong> the knowledge you need for understanding a thing is distributed across people, projects, devices, and environments. Ties into service design,could even extend to getting different devices to talk to one another</li>

        <h3>White space</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space?r=stephanie-krus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The power of white space</strong></a></p>
        <p>White space (negative space) is the area between design elements. It's another tool for designers to design for the user experience (UX). Remember that white space is not necessarily white; it’s just the name to indicate spaces where there are neither user interface (UI) elements nor specific content.</p>
        <p>As a designer, you can introduce white space based on four main factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>content</li>
          <li>design</li>
          <li>user</li>
          <li>brand</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use <strong>macro white space</strong> to organize content in the layout and direct the user through the blocks of content shown. Use <strong>micro white space</strong> inside the design element features as seen in the text, images and content blocks.</p>
        <p>We can also approach white space as being <strong>passive or active</strong>. Passive white space does not have a specific role in the design other than facilitating the user experience. It is all about being easier to read. Active white space guides the focus and attention of users. It is more about standing out and making a statement.</p>
