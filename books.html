            <h2  id="help">Presenting design work - Donna Spencer</h2>
            <p>When consulting, there are 2 context in which you'll present "final" version of a project in a quite formal way: milestones and final presenations.<br>
            The goal is sign off. And sometimes to get paid. <br>
            These should be well prepared and rehearsed<br>
            You should never give the first presentation at the same time as you are asking for the sign off. You should also not present anything new at that point.<br>
            Ifyou present work in progess here, you will be frustrated that you are asked to make changes and the client will be frustrated that you didn't get it right.<br>
            Make it clear upfront that any feedback at this point will inform a follow-up phase of work. Be very clear that you are asking for sign-off (and payment)<br>
            Don't beat around the bush or avoid the discussion, this is what you are here to do.<br>
            Then present a summary of everything you have presented before. Don't add anything new. There should be nothing new to react to and no surprise for the client. <br>
            If the client attempt to give feedback, reverse a decision, or ask additional work (and they will no matter how well you have presented in the past and how well you've managed feedback), refer back to previous discussions and decisions. Which of course you have been documenting and sharing all along. <br>
            If something unexpected happen, like a more senior person turning up for the first time and wanting to provide input, reiterate what you have presented in the past, the feedback you've received and the decisions made as a group. Involve the rest of the group to support these decisions. And during the next round, make sure that senior person is involved throughout.</p>
            <p><strong>Present the lowest fidelity that will achieve the presenation's goals.</strong> People will give feedback on what they see (even when you prepare well by giving people jobs and describing scope). If people see a beautiful, full color, high fidelity design with great images, that's what they'll give feedback on, and you'll lose valuable time talking about visuals when you really wanted to talk about the user flow<br>
            If you want feedback on user flow and content, show the design without imagery and colour. This is perfect time to show a rough sketch or a black and white wireframe. People who have never seen a wireframe before might wonder what they are looking at. You can reassure them that they aren't looking at a terrible final design by showing before and after images from a different project that also had a wireframing phase; people usually only need a small example to understanfd what wireframe is.<br>
          If you want feedback on layout, use some version of fake content, so people don't get caught up in the details of what the in progress copy says. <strong>For years, I've been usin text from classic fiction (like Alice in wonderland) - it's less confusing than lorem ipsum and people usually smile and understand it.</strong></p>
          <p>A simple feedback structure:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>remind your audience what the scope is and isn't</li>
            <li>Remind them of the jobs you gave them and what they should focus on</li>
            <li>add some general questions like: "what are you most looking forward to?", "Is there anything that could become a problem?"</li>
            <li>Ask people to provide examples to support their comments</li>
            <li>Never ask: "What do you think?" or "do you like it?" - You will not get concrete, useful feedback with these questions</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Feedback after the presenation:</strong> if you don't give people enough time tp contribute, they will derail your presentation until their feedback is address. After the presentation, always send people a message with clear instruction around what you want them to do and how they should do it. Don't rely on people to remember what they have agreed to. Give them a deadline and follow up a few days before the deadline. </p>
          <p>You must be able to explain why you have decided not to do something about feedback people have given you. Or they will give you the same feedback endlessly.</p>
          <p>To sum up:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>if you plan for your audience and give everyone a job, they'll contribute their expertise, not their opinion</li>
            <li>if you show the end result, not your progress or process, your audience will understand what you are showing them and won't get distracted by process details</li>
            <li>if you present a person doing a thing and tell a compelling story, your audience will give feedback on the story, not the features</li>
            <li>if you set up a clear feedback process and teach your clients how to give feedback, they will give you relevant and useful feedback</li>
            <li>if you make clear decision about the feedback and communicate these decisions back to the client, they'll trust that you are listening to them</li>
          </ol>

            <h2  id="help">Rethinking Users - Michael Youngblood, Benjamin Chesluk and Nadeem Haidary</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.rethinkingusers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link to the book</a></p>
            <p>Book with cards and excercises</p>
            <p>When we think about people, we think about their socio-cultural ecosystem; the entire network of interconnectioned people, and things around them. When we use the term "user ecosystem", this is what we mean:all the different kind of users of a given product or service and how they connect to each other.</p>
            <p>A definition of Human centred design: we see design as the thoughful and purposeful conceptualisation of novel products, services, public space and just about anything else, tangible or intangible, with the intent to solve a problem for one or more users</p>
            <p>A user is anyone who has a personal experience of a design artefact</p>
            <p>All users are stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are users. This is an important distinction. We define stakeholders as people or entities that have a stake - a personal interest - in the design artefact and it's impact on others. But stakeholders do not necessarily have a personal experience with that artefact</p>
            <p>this kind of appreciation for a broader range of users' experience is part of what made Sesame street, so successful. The writers and producers understood that the show had to be simultaneously interesting for parents who would often be in the same room with their children and would make decision about what programme to watch. Sesame steeet includes jokes and story twists directed at adults, as well as guest appearances by celbrities to keep adults engages along their children</p>
            <p>artefact + context + compex user ecosystem = user experience</p>
            <p>the user archetype are: free of personal characteristics, free of emotions, agnostic of users' intentions or goals and empirically derived</p>
            <p>User archetypes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>direct user</li>
              <li>indirect user</li>
              <li>intermediary user</li>
              <li>governing user</li>
              <li>dependent user</li>
              <li>parallel user</li>
              <li>complementary user</li>
              <li>serial user</li>
              <li>surrogate user</li>
              <li>terminal user</li>
              <li>ambient user</li>
              <li>conglomerate user</li>
              <li>autonomic user</li>

            <p>The community around Grenfell Tower is like many with which I'm familiar: communities regarded as 'deprived', where there is a pathological suspicion of outsidersand of the authorities; where there is a deeply ingrained belief that there is no point in participating in the democratic process because people in power do not care about the concerns of the 'underclass'.</p>
            <p>It's not like I was the only one at my school who struggled. Regular readers were the exception. Reading was not regarded as a leisure activity, more a necessary evil, something to be endured. Where I diverged from many of my classmates was that I privately longed to read every book I picked up. However, to my frustration and later, resignation, I always found, not long after starting one, that I could never see it through.</p>
            <p>I preferred taking in information that I could interact with. Discussion was more engaging and fun, and was not an endurance test like reading. By talking and listening to what others had to say and paying attention to how they said it, I developed an ability to communicate with different type of people on a broad range of subjects, which might even have suggested I was an avid reader.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On working with groups in prison</p>
            <p>In here [prison] people don't make distinctios between grasses and sex offenders. For many of the young men, 'not grassing' is what constitutes their moral compass. For some, no crime is quite as shameful as giving information to police that results in someone else's criminal conviction.</p>
            <p>Slashing someone over a bit of toast may appear brutal, mndless and babaric, but in a twisted way, it may also be an attempt to reduce the threat of violence further down the line. People are unlikely to mess with the guy who will slash you over a piece of toast and this rationale, which is pathological in violent communities, is as much about survival as it is about pride and reputation.
              In fact, pride and bravado are often just a social extension of a deeper survival instinct. Regardless of the context of violence, it's function is often the same; it's not just practical but performative and designed to ward off potential agressors as well as eliminating a direct threat. Not everyone who comes here is violent but it's hard not to get drawn into the culture of violence once you arrive. It's often the case that people leave prison far more violent than they arrived.</p>
            <p>It's useful not to make too many assumptions about individuals and groups, based on how they behave initially. A serial interrupter mayb have a hearing problem or a learning difficulty. Obviously, I can't clear my head of all presumption, but what I can choose to observe are those assumptions as they emerge in my mind without acting on them. These assumptions say as much about me as they do about the subject of my judgement.</p>
            <p>In the prison environment, when leading a discussion, I try to regard all forms of verbal communication as valid, at least in this early stage. It's important not to impose rules too quickly either - especially if I have not yet established basic facts about who I'm talking to. In these initial moments, what I'm trying to do is build a rapport, based on mutual respect, that will hopefully make it easier for me to negotiate entry into their community. I increase my chances of doing that by acknowledging them as people with agency.</p>
            <p>Every intreaction is importnant because it presents on opportunity to acknowledge or reaffirm soemthing about the participant.</p>
            <p>They will instinctively attempt to ascertain the distance between who I really am and who I say I am. In this envvironment, [prison] authenticity is the yardstick by which all people are measured.</p>
            <p>When people come here to work, they often adopt personas that they think will appeal to the participants, forgetting the prison population is filled with some of the most emotionally intuitive and manipulative people you are liekly to find.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On violence</p>
            <p>The key to enduring a violent episode at the hands of someone you can't evade or fight back against, is usually to submit and hope that you won't sustain a serious injury</p>
            <br>
            <p>[In a residential area] It seems like things gained more value the older they got, as opposed to falling into derilection. Here things were built to last and the architecture seemed to project that quality outwards.</p>
            <p>The oddest thing, however, was that you never saw anybody coming or going from those tenements and you never saw neighbours talking to each other. It was almost as if people never grew up here, but instead bought their way in and that their house were all lying empty because everyone was out at work. Mind-boggling.</p>
            <br>
            <p>...what I did get was that everyone I had grown up with was really pissed off and that I should be too. In fact, it was almost rude - taboo even - not to be angry at soemthing and so long as your anger was directed at one of the many sanctioned targets, then there would be not shortage of allies to validate your grievance.</p>

            <h2  id="tools">Tools for conviviality - Ivan Illich</h2>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tools-for-conviviality.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-tenth-width" src="assets/images/tools-for-conviviality.jpg" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" /></a></p>
            <p>The exclusion of mothers, aunts, and other nonprofessionals from the care of their pregnant, hurt, sick or dying relatives and friends resulted in new demands for medical services at a much faster rate than the medical establishment could deliver.<br>
            <strong>As the value of services rose, it became almost impossible for people to care.</strong></p>
            <p>Like the modern school system, hospital-based health care fits the principle that those who have will receive even more and those who have not will be taken for the little that they have</p>
            <p>People have lost the right to declare themselves sick; society now accepts their claims to sickness only after certification by medical bureaucrats</p>
            <p>In the case of transportation, it has taken almost a century to pass from an era served by motorized vehicles to the era in which society has been reduced to virtual enslavement to the car.</p>
            <p>The cure for bad management is more management. The cure for specialized research is more costly interdisciplinary research, just as the cure for polluted rivers is more costly non polluting detergents. The pooling of stores of information, the building up of a knowledge stock, the attempt to overwhelm present problems by the production of more science is the ultimate attempt to solve a crisis by escalation</p>
            <p>The hypothesis was that machine can replace slaves. The evidence shows taht, used for this purpose, machine enslave men.</p>
            <p>I choose the term "conviviality" to designate the opposite of industrial productivity. I intend it to mean <strong>autonomous and creative intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their environment;</strong> and this in contrast with the conditioned response of persos to the demands made upon them by others, and by a man-made environment. I consider conviviality to be individual freedom realised in personal interdependence and as such, an intrinsic ethical value.</p>
            <p>I propose the vision of a convivial society. It would be the result of social arrangement that guarantee for each member the most ample and free access to the tools of the community and limit this freedom only in favor of another member's equal freedom.'</p>

                <p><span class="lou">A service is something that helps someone to do something</span></p>
                <p><a href="assets/images/sd/good-services.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-tenth-width" src="assets/images/sd/good-services.png" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" /></a></p>
                <p>Pre internet era services still account for the vast majority of services we use and were designed for a very different world to the one we now live in. We often don't rely on a new technology until that technology is ubiquitous. since we don't have a clear definition of this, the more cautious organisations often lag well behind, waiting until the majority of their customers use a particular technology before changing their services.</p>
                <p>The simple fact that our services weren't designed for the channel they're delivered in, is one of the most common causes of service failure.</p>

                <p><strong>A timeline of services</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1800s: letters</li>
                    services start to be available remotely
                    <li>1920s: forms</li>
                    letters of request become codified into form to improve speed and accuracy 
                    <li>1960s: forms + support</li>
                    first call centres become popular
                    <li>1970s: process + forms + support</li>
                    introduction of computerised processes and increasing number of unique IDs and account numbers
                    <li>1970s: process + forms + customer service</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Services today are composed of small component pieces joined together through data or user experience to form a seamless user journey that helps a user achieve their goal.</p>
                <p>In a way, each service is broken down into steps, and each steps into a series of tasks. Each one of these tasks will probably be called 'a service' by the person running it. What defines the edge of a service is very dependent on your context, so if all you do all day everyday is provide surveys, it's easy to think of the service as providing surveys. </p>
                <p>Your user defines what a service is by what it is they want to achieve</p>
                <p>The way your user thinks and talks about your service is likely to be different to the way that you do.</p>
<br>
                <p><strong>A good service should:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>be easy to find</strong></li>
                    ... by a user with no prior knowledge of the task they are set out to do.<br>
                    Where your user starts will depend on how much they're already aware of what services might be available to meet their needs. Your job is to make sure that they can get from this goal to the service you provide, without having to resort to support.<br>
                    <span class="lou-g">Good services are verbs</span><span class="lou-y">Bad services are nouns</span>:<br>
                    For most organisations, services are individual discrete actions that need to be completed in a specific order (like 'account registration'). Because these isolated activities need to be identifiable for the people operating them, we've given them names, nouns, to help us keep track of them internally.<br>
                    Over time, these names become exposed to users, even if we don't mean them to be initially.<br> 
                    We often place users in a situation where to find something they need to know exactly what they are looking for.<br>
                    <span class="lou">Google is the homepage of your service</span><br>
                    The name of your service makes a statement to your user about what your service does for them.<br>

                    To name your service: avoid legal or technical language, describe a task, not a technology, don't use acronyms.<br><br>
                
                    <li><strong>clearly explain its purpose</strong></li>
                    The purpose must be clear to the user at the start of the service. A user with no prior knowledge must understand:<br>
                    - what the service does<br>
                    - why it does it <br>
                    - how it does it<br>
                    - who it is for <br>
                    <br>
                    You need to clearly communicate this by the service name and description and even the interface of how it works<br><br>
                    <li><strong>set a user's expectations of it</strong></li>
                    Explain what is needed from the user to complete the service, what the user can expect from the service provider in return (for example: how long something will take to complete, how much it cost, any restrictions).<br>
                    Before wondering how you're going to manage your users expectations, it's important to understand what expectations they have in the first place. Most people base their expectations on past experiences. You need to do your research.<br>
                    <br>There are 3 types of expectations: <br>
                      - universal (fundamental to your service - to monitor closely, but not need to explain it)<br>
                      - assumed (things a user don't know about your service - most important to explain upfront)<br>
                      - outliners (only some users but need to keep an eye because it can become a universal very quickly)<br>
                      It's important to consider all 3 types when designing. Try to meet as many of these expectations as you can and when you can't, explain why.<br><br>

                        <li>look at your organisation's ability to deliver all of this service - if not feasable, then define what a rational scope for it your part of that end-to-end service will be</li>
                        <li>consider which part of the service it makes senses to deliver first - start small and build or improve in increments</li>
                        <li>look at how data gets shared between the organisations delivering the service - are there things you could share that would make it easier for your user? or things that you need from organisations that would enable you to provide a better service?</li>

                    <li><strong>require no prior knowledge to use</strong></li>
                    In recent years, a new generation of 'parasitic services' have evolved to help us negociate some of the more cumbersome and difficult to understand services. There is often a cost to it, which means some users who can't afford this are excluded.<br>
                    It's particularly prevalent in the public sector, where there are many services who believe their users to be brokers, conveyancers, tax specialist or legal advisors. <br>
                    <span class="lou">Our understanding of a new service is based on past experiences</span><br>
                    <span class="lou-y">When people don't know how something work, they make it up</span><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>make sure your service is findable (look at the language your user use to look for it) (principle 1)</li>
                        <li>clearly explain what your service is for (principle 2)</li>
                        <li>make no presumption about how much your user knows</li>
                        <li>work in a way that is familiar (principle 5)</li>
                        <li>work in a way that is agnostic to organsational structures (principle 7)</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <li><strong>be agnostic of organisational structures</strong></li>
                    The service must work in a way that doesn't unnecessarily expose a user to the internal structures of the organisation providing it.<br>
                    For the first time, we are facing unprecedented demands to join up our services that finally match our ability to do something about it. Providing these joined-up services poses a number of challenges that go beyond what skills we have or what software we use.<br>
                    <br>There are 4 fundamental ways our services are designed that cause siloed, fragmented journeys, despite our ability to join those up across organisational boundaries. <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>separation of data</li>
                        <li>incompatible processes (different deadlines for example)</li>
                        <li>incompatible criteria of use</li>
                        <li>inconsistent language</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="lou">Getting something done is always more important than who is providing the service</span><br>
                    <span class="lou-y">Collaboration is the new target operating model</span><br>
                    If collaboration was easy, we'd all be doing it. The reality is that it's very hard to start, and even harder to continue. People in different parts of an organisation, or other organisations altogether, work at a different pace, have different objectives and sometimes even financial incentives that mean that they are often at odds with one another.<br>
                    <br>4 things to support people to collaborate on one shared service:<br>
                    - permission: allow people to step outside of their day job to work together<br>
                    - shared standards <br>
                    - shared goals (and everyone fully getting behind)<br>
                    - shared incentives<br>
                    <br>
                    In summary:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>recognise the potential silos in your organisation - or with other organisations that might be providing parts of the same services</li>
                        <li>if you can't change your operating model, change the way you communicate and collaborate</li>
                        <li>consider things that create a permissive environment for collaboration, like shared standards, goals and incentives, to help people work together</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <li><strong>require the minimum possible steps to complete</strong></li>
                    Everything new steps in your service is a transitional moment. The difference between choosing something and buying it, or between buying and returning it. <br>
                    <span class="lou-g">The number of steps in your service should be equal to the number of decisions your user has to make, no more no less</span><br>
                    A good rule of thumb is to think for yourself: if this thing was done automatically without my knowing about it, would that be a good thing? if the answer is no, then it's best to create a separate step to your service to make sure that your user has full visibility and control over what they are doing.<br>
                    <span class="lou-y">Don't just design the steps of your service, design the space between them</span><br>
                    Involved services: slower steps (medical services for example)<br>
                    Transactional services: needs to be done very quickly with as little interaction as possible<br>
                    <br>
                    In summary:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>review where decisions need to be made in your service (look at your service end-to-end)</li>
                        <li>allow users to focus on one task at a time</li>
                        <li>think about how fast or slow your steps need to be</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>be consistent throughout</strong></li>
                    The service should look and feel like one service throughout, regardless of the channel it is delivered through. The language used should be consistent, as should visual style and interaction patterns.<br>
                    A service can be inconsistent between steps in this service or between channels, for example the online channel might be well designed the set of values and processes has not been communicated to the rest of the organisation (face-to-face or phone)<br>
                    A strength held in one area should be consistently shared across organisation.<br>
                    <span class="lou-g">Good services are only as strong as their weakest link</span><br>
                    While it's vital for services to be consistent, they are also complex and varied, and some parts of your service will need to look and behave differently from the rest. For example, how you talk to your users when they sign up for an account is different to how you then talk to your users when they have a complaint that needs solving.<br>
                    <span class="lou-y">Good services are consistent, not uniform</span><br>
                    4 dimensions of consistency: across user journey, in each channel, over time, between users<br>
                    <br>Principles:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>every breach of consistency is a breach of trust</li>
                        <li>focus on the abilities of your whole organisation, not on the skills of your superstar players</li>
                        <li>empower staff to make individual decisions about users</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>have no dead ends</strong></li>
                    A service should direct all users, regardless of whether the user is eligible or suitable to use the service. No user should be left behind or stranded within a service without knowing how to continue.<br>
                    <br>4 main reasons for dead ends:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>they're not eligible to use your service</li>
                        <li>they've strayed off the beaten track</li>
                        <li>they can't do something (unable to remember a date, follow complex instructions, go somewhere physically, do something during working hours, read a pdf, or service is not accessible)</li>
                        <li>they don't have access to something</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Things that most services presume users have access to:<br>
                    - phone number<br>
                    - bank account<br>
                    - email address<br>
                    - ID <br>
                    - an address or proof of address<br>
                    - any of the above in the country you are operating in <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How you can mitigate dead ends in your service:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>provide onward routes for people who aren't eligible to use your service</li>
                        <li>ensure your service is inclusive</li>
                        <li>minimise the number of 'requirements' you ask your users</li>
                        <li>build affordances  (alternative routes)</li>
                        <li>let your service degrade gracefully (when services fail, you can rely on the technology that came before it)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>be usable by everyone, equally</strong></li>
                    The service must be usable by everyone who needs to use it, regardless of their circumstances or abilities. No one should be less able to use the service than anyone else.<br>
                    <span class="lou-y">There is no such thing as a 'normal' user</span><br>
                    <span class="lou-g">Inclusion is a necessity, not an enhancement</span><br>

                    <br>To try to see why someone might be excluded from your service, think of:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What they do: try to think in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Try to consider both short term reasons why someone might have an issue and long term ones as both group might have very different adaption strategies</li>
                        <li>who they are (gender, age, ethnic background, sex, religion  ...) </li>
                        <li>what they have (transportation, friends, home, money, education)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <span class="lou-y">Inclusion means that your user can not only use your service but feel safe, welcome and use it in a way that make them feel equal to all other users</span><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>some changes should be predicted, and some can be expected. Work on the assumption that nothing is fixed - make it easy for users to change things about themselves</li>
                        <li>make a list of all the changes that might happen to a user when using your service and work out which ones need to be directly designed for as functionality, and which don't</li>
                        <li>for changes that directly change the way your service works, always give the users the option of doing this at the point that this information becomes relevant, but always make sure they're aware of who knows about this change and what that information will be used for</li>
                        <li>not all changes should be universal; always give users the ability to share only what they want to share with the people they want to share with</li>

            <p><strong>Mental screen</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>focus on the mental, not the physical screen</li>
              <li>factor in the attention environment</li>
              <li>use information compression techniques</li>
              <li>incorporate attention filters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.</p>
            <p>Being poor means coping not just with a shortfall of money, but also with a concurrent shortfall of cognitive resources. The scientists estimate that the congitive impact of poverty is roughly equvalent to losing a full night of sleep or suffering a 13 point drop in IQ scores. (page 24)</p>
            <p>At a certain point, the amount of information doesn't just create a scaricity of attention - it actually makes it harder to deploy whatever attention we have left. If everythin gis impotant then nothing is. (page 27)</p>
            <p>We need to treat attention as a literal resource</p>

            <p><strong>Function follows form</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Fast-test" your site</li>
              <li>maximise visceral beauty</li>
              <li>when in doubt, err on the side of simplicity</li>
              <li>remember: function follows form</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We know what we like before we even know what we're looking at. Decades of psychological science clearly demonstrate that many of our choices, behaviours and beliefs are rooted in processing that takes place before we even know what we're preceiving. Screens might be exagerating this human tendency. When it comes to our digital behaviour we are even more influenced than usual by these very fast verdicts generated by the unconscious brain.</p>
            <p>Online fist impressions are so important that it's only a matter of time before websites begin tailoring their look to reflect our actual unconscious preferences.</p>
            <p>In the future, our browser might automatically "format" websites in accordance with our visual preferences.</p>
            <p>The unattractiveness of sites is directly related to other, more importnant issues, such as a perceived lack of usability and the absence of trust. These correlations might not be rational, but they still shape the perceptions of millions of consumers.</p>

            <p><strong>Display biases</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>optimise the use of hot spots</li>
              <li>avoid cold spots</li>
              <li>consider cultural differences in hotspot location</li>
              <li>factor in the horinzontal bias</li>
              <li>sometimes zoom out, not in</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>New mirror</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>calibrate the amount of feedback</li>
              <li>use just-in-time education</li>
              <li>leverage the fresh start effect</li>
              <li>make us feel the feedback</li>
              <li>use carrots (and not sticks) whenever possible</li>
              <li>be aware of social media conformity effect</li>
              <li>take screen anonymity into account</li>
              <li>empower feedback with an action plan</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Computer feel anonymous: while we care about the feedback we get from humans, we know that machines are just a bundle of microships and wires, running a code zeros and ones. As a result, we're less concerned about the feedback given to us by screens.</p>
            <p>People are far more honest when interacting with a screen instead of a person. This is known as the diinhibition effect, and it's often triggered by the presence of tecnology. But while anonymous devices seem to make us more honest, they also lead us to indulge in irresponsible behaviours. We are less worried about what other people will think.</p>


            <p><strong>Desirable difficulty</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>consider ugly fonts (and other forms of visual disfluency)</li>
              <li>use congitive disfluency to slow the mind down</li>
              <li>calibrate disfluency to fit your site's goals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When the speedy mind is made to slow down, people engage with the material at a deeper level.</p>
            <p>The best design is not about making it as easy as possible on the eyes. Rather, it's about balancing the demands for cognitive ease with the benefits of desirable difficulty; the craving for speed with the benefits of slowing us down. If used properly, disfluency is not about turning people off. It's about making them notice what they'd normally skim over, using visual cues to encourage them to think more deeply about the material on the screen. The form of information should serve it's ultimate goal. Easy is good, but sometimes hard is even better.</p>


            <p><strong>Digital tailoring</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>use personalise visuals and videos</li>
              <li>tailor the timing of messages</li>
              <li>tailor the menus to each individual</li>
              <li>offer more than one Web site</li>
              <li>remember: too much personalisation can backfire</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Personalisation enhances our attention and enjoyment for two reasons. The first reason is that it increases levels of intrnsic motivation. Because the information seems "self-relevant". The second reason involves a factor known as "perceived competence" as subjects exposed to personalised information are more convinced that they can excel.</p>


            <p><strong>Choice opportunity</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>offer a manageable consideration set</li>
              <li>personalise categories</li>
              <li>incorporate choice tournaments</li>
              <li>manage regret with choice closure</li>
              <li>avoid navigation overload</li>
              <li>manage attribute overload</li>
              <li>maximise satisfaction, not clicks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While too little choice is stifling, having too many choices can be paralysing; our bounded brain is overwhelmed, and we end up picking badly or giving up.</p>
            <p>It's not enough to offer people lots of possibilities on their screens. If you want to succeed, you need to help them find the right one. Customers want websites and apps that make it easier for them to make a smart choice.</p>
            <p>The goal is not an elimination of clicks, but to make every click useful.</p>


            <p><strong>Thinking apps</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>start with choice architecture</li>
              <li>set the right information environment</li>
              <li>offer thinking tools</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>General</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>use science to drive your design and A/B testing</li>

              <li>remember: the medium shapes the message</li>

            <p><strong>Shared documents aren't shared understanding // The real goal of using stories is shared understanding.</strong><br>
            There's always more to build than we have time or resources to build - always. Minimise output and maximise outcome and impact.</p>
            <p>Stories aren't written form of requirements; telling stories through collaboration with words and pictures is a mechanism that builds shared understanding.<br>
            Stories aren't the requirments; they're discussions about solving problems for our organisation, our customers and our users that lead to agreements on what to build.</p>
            <p>Story maps are for breaking down big stories as you tell them.</p>
            <p>Focus on the breath of the story before diving into depth</p>
            <p><strong>Scope doesn't creep; understanding grows</strong></p>
            <p>Focusing on specific target outcomes is the secret to prioritise development work: don't prioritise features, prioritise outcomes.</p>
            <p>MVP is not the crappiest product you could possibly release, it's the smallest product release that successfully achieve it's desired outcomes. It's also the smallest thing you could create or do to prove or disporve an assumption.</p>
            <p>Map only what you need to support your conversation.<br>
            The best estimates come from developers who really understand what they're estimating.</p>
            <p>User tasks are the basic building blocks of a story map. Tasks are what we do.<br>
            Use the goal-level concept to help you aggregate small tasks or decompose large tasks.</p>
            <p>Maps are organised left to right using a narrative flow: the order in which you'd tell the story.<br>
            Activities and high level tasks form the back-bone of a story map. // Use a slice (horizontal) to identify all the tasks and details relevant to specific outcomes.</p>
            <p>A right-sized story from a: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>user's perspective: </strong>one that fulfills a need</li>
              <li><strong>development team's perspective: </strong>one that takes just a few days to build and test</li>
              <li><strong>business perspective: </strong>one that helps a business achieve a business outcome</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keep your progress and quality visible to stakeholders inside your organisation</p>
            <p>Prioritise specific business goals, customers and users, and then their goals, beofre prioritising features (that's last)</p>
