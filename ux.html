                    <p>Hello! Does anyone if there is such a thing as tutorials about pulling data into a prototype via json?<br>
                        Essentially you can put your data files in to app/data/ and then import them to the sesssion-data-defaults.js file<br>
                        Here's <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-trainee-teachers-prototype/blob/master/app/data/session-data-defaults.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my session-data-defaults.js</a> file session-data-defaults.js<br>
                        Lines 1-8 you can see me use require - this is where you could instead reference your own json<br>
                        once you've required the data blob, you need to add it to the object that gets exported (lines 61-80 in mine)<br>
                        you might need to include the extension too - so require('./file.json')<br>
                        Most of my data files are javascript files rather than json files, which don't need an extension<br>
                        Example of my data files: https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-trainee-teachers-prototype/tree/master/app/data</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Why the prototype kit should not be used for production code</p>
                    <p>it would not be remotely safe to do so.<br>
                        The kit actively does things to help prototyping that are not safe in production, and should not handle real user data. Things like automatically storing all GET and POST data.<br>
                        The way it handles session data is also not safe.<br>
                        Much of the code was written by non-developers (me! and others) and is not necessarily production ready.<br>
                        Besides intentional features that cause security issues, there are likely lots of other security and privacy issues.<br>
                        It has some tests, but is largely untested.</p>

                    <li>Words: Whether it is text or voice, words are how a digital designer primarily thinks. The best designers spend
                        enough time to choose the right word because the right words drive the right actions</li>
                    <li>Code: Words without code are print. Without good code there can be no Web and the best code is lean</li>

                        using the Web. However, too often traditional visual designers ruin the Web with their desire to create visual
                        spectacle, and to impress their peers or bosses. (Senior managers being the group most susceptible to visual

                        Web is made, link by link. To link to and to be linked to; that is the question the digital designer is
                        constantly exploring</li>
                    <li>Human networks: The greatest digital designs always—always—leverage and support the efforts of other humans on
                        the networks to become better and more useful. The Web connects us and uses us as much as we use the Web</li>
                    <li>Information DNA: The Web is a sandy beach across which we all walk in bare feet. It has a memory of every move,
                        and the more we walk the more we write out our information DNA, our memory. On the Web, your footprints can last
                        for a very long time. Digital designers are always learning to better read and use this DNA, sometimes for good,
                        sometimes for ill</li>
                    <li>Information architecture: Metadata is the kid they all ignored, that many bullied, laughed at. The digital
                        designer loves metadata because the digital designer must be—must be—an information architect. Complex,
                        demanding, and wholly ignored by the amateurs, you cannot build anything useful that will be easy to find and
                        easy to use without excelling at information architecture</li>
                    <li>Findability: A great digital designer is always thinking of how each element of the design will be found. They
                        think of people as active, participative, autonomous, intelligent—driven by a need, wanting to complete a task.
                        The poor designers think of people sitting somewhere waiting to be wowed by their amazing design. Good designers
                        design for the searcher</li>
                    <li>Time: Ethical digital designers always want people to take the least possible time with their designs. To get in
                        to get out and get on with their busy lives. Their first thought is “what can I remove?” not “what can I add?”.
                        The dark designers dream of trapping people, of consuming as much of their time as possible, of creating
                        addicts. These designers obsess about engagement—a code word for addiction</li>
                    <li>Social: The best digital designers design with people not for them. They hunger for opportunities to see people
                        use their designs, and they are always learning and refining, reshaping, evolving through the lens of
                        observation and use</li>
                    <li>Maintainers: Great digital designers think holistically, think into the future, are not obsessed with the new.
                        They care, they nurture, they worry about how things will be looked after. They design for maintenance and
                        evolution. They see their designs as living and they know that the greatest thing you learn about living is to
                        love maintenance, to make art and beauty out of maintenance. And to continuously improve the design because if
                        there’s one things about digital, it’s that it’s never done. Digital is never done</li>

                    For services where the digital experience is just one of a number of touchpoints, having a Service Designer orchestrate those touchpoints makes a lot of sense. </p>

    <h2>80/20 The Pareto principle</h2>
    <p>A Management Consultant Joseph M Juran back in the 1940s. He noticed that there is a general rule in business and in life – that 80% of the effects of a process come from just 20% of the inputs. He named this principle the “Pareto Principle” after the Italian Economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923).<br>
        The Pareto Principle is useful because it allows us to focus our efforts on the areas that bring the most rewards. It’s used in almost every business discipline. For example, sales people will note that 20% of their accounts bring 80% of their sales.
    </p>
    <p>It’s important to note that 80%/20% is not exact. <strong> What is almost always true is that a small proportion of the efforts (inputs) will generate a larger than expected level of results (outputs).</strong>
        It doesn’t matter how complex your website or application is, you will find that when you dig down into user analytics – the Pareto Principle will come into play. A small fraction of the functionality (or pages) will receive the majority of user time; this doesn’t mean that the rest of the functionality or content has no value but it does mean that some functionality and content is more important to the majority of your users than some of the rest.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The Pareto Principle or 80-20 Rule can be very effective in helping you make decisions in your user experience work. </strong>From research and analytics to higher level stuff like project management, wherever there is data that can be quantified there’s the possibility that you can use this rule to focus your efforts on the areas of your work that bring the most results.<br>
        However, you always need to be mindful of sample sizes and of other forms of data which may override the Pareto Principle in practice.

    <p>At its core, A/B testing is exactly what it sounds like: you have two versions of an element (A and B) and a metric that defines success. To determine which version is better, you subject both versions to experimentation simultaneously. In the end, you measure which version was more successful and select that version for real-world use.</p>
    <p>If you change more than one variable, this is multivariate testing and need a lot of traffic to your website to be used</p>

    <p>Identifying good vs. bad feedback:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bad feedback focuses on the solution, and not the problem</li>
        <li>Bad feedback includes personal likes and dislikes</li>
        <li>Bad feedback is directed to the designer, not to the design</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A good way to prevent bad feedback of coming up in the first place is to start every meeting with a recap of the goals. What are we trying to achieve here? Where are we in the process? What feedback are we expecting to discuss today?</p>
    <p>Discussing the feedback you received:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Listen more than you speak</li>
        <li>Ask for clarification</li>
        <li>Write down the feedback</li>
        <li>Create scenarios</li>
        <li>Push for consensus<br>
            It’s common that two people will hijack design critique sessions to discuss a specific point, but it is important for the designer to make sure other participants also agree with what’s being discussed. What you don’t want is to make a change based on what one of your peers/clients thinks, and then have the new version be disliked by someone else who was quiet the first time

        In Terms of Charts, Less is More<br>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1293027343674552320" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Twitter thread - Jared Spool</strong></a></p>
    <p>
    Dashboards report on current status. <br>
    Users don’t act on status. <br>
    They act on change in status.<br> 
    Dashboards are passive when the user needs something active. <br>
    They are a failure before it happens.<br>
    “Users wouldn’t ask if they didn’t need them.”<br>
    Oh, there’s a need alright. <br>
    Dashboards aren’t a need. They are a solution. And, often, the wrong one. <br>
    Learn more about the problem and a better solution will likely present itself.<br>
    Dashboards are often a designer’s response to not understanding the full scale of a complex problem ecology.<br>
    In systems design, a dashboard is an attempt to understand the system interactions. Unfortunately, it rarely works.<br>
    At best, a dashboard is an intermediate stopgap to understanding the problem dynamics. <br>
    Give the user a temporary dashboard and study how they use it.<br>
    Unfortunately, most projects deliver the dashboard and never study the behaviors that come from it.<br>
    People keep bringing up car dashboards, so let’s take them apart for a moment.<br>
    Most of what’s in the dashboard isn’t needed for driving the car. The tachometer and temperature gauges, for example, are vestigial to today’s driving experience.<br>
    Drivers do use the gas gauge and speedometer. However, that are also a holdover from a time when cars were dumber.<br>
    Your don’t need to know how fast the car is going. You need to optimize your speed for safety.<br>
    Similarly, you don’t need to know how much gas is left. You need to know if you have enough fuel to get to your destination.<br>
    Today’s cars are (or can be) smarter. Waze tells me if I’m driving too fast. Why can’t my car? Why would it even let me drive too fast?<br>
    If Waze had access to the fuel sensor, it could tell me if I’ll need gas during the trip. It could even route me to the cheapest gas station enroute. <br>
    This could be car intelligence. If the car did these things (see Autonomous Vehicle technology), I wouldn’t need the guages.<br>
    Many folks in this discussion seem to think that I believe there’s a better design solution than a dashboard. <br>
    I don’t.<br>
    I believe there’s a better user experience than what dashboards provide their users, but the UX will depend on what decisions the dashboard tries to afford.<br>
    Dashboards, in their simplest form, are information displays.<br>
    Users either absorb the information or they ignore them.<br>
    In either case, they are then making a judgement and acting upon it.<br>
    Dashboards leave room for tremendous error because users didn’t react appropriately.<br>
    If we want to eliminate those errors, we need to eliminate the dashboard and replace it with something that actually assists (for some value of assistance >1% and ≤100%) the decision making process.<br>
    That might be full-on automation, or it could just be decision support.<br>
    In any case, the “replacement” for the dashboard is a decision support mechanism of some sort.<br>
    There won’t be a “best practice,” because this is a complex systems issue.<br>
    You can’t have best practices in complex systems. They are only helpful in complicated or simple systems.

    <p>A sitemap footer has the ability to minimize the efforts users need to take in navigating through a website. When you design clear and distinct links and place them in the footer at the bottom of the page, you allow users to explore other sections or navigate directly to relevant information, without having to return to the top of the page and navigate through the entire hierarchy. When implemented successfully, footers can take some of the pressure off the global navigation bar at the top of the page, resulting in a less cluttered and more appealing interface. Better still, if you use them consistently, they will serve as reassuring beacons for where to go next, thus lubricating the user’s journey to make it more seamless while helping optimize the whole experience.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>it clashes with the platform navigation pattern</li>
        <li>hamburger menu lacks efficiency (top left hard to reach on a small screen)</li>
        <li>unclear information architecture</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Navigation Goals</strong>, it has to tell a user three things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>where am I?</li>
        <li>where else can I go</li>
        <li>what will I find when I get there?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Review your Information Architecture:</strong><br>
        Do a user research by using card sorting method. Let your users categorize your IA based on their intuition and their “information scents” to know more on what the users want and how they would like to use the apps. After you did a little research, then you can start building your new IA for your apps.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Start using tab bars:</strong><br>
        So far, the best solution for mobile apps seems to be a tab bar. Either you place it on the top or the bottom of the screen. (It’s up to you where you want to put it. But it would best to put it on top if you are designing for responsive web). When you have your new IA, you can prioritize to use 4–5 icon + text button for your primary navigation options. This is the approach that Facebook has settled for their mobile apps and their apps navigation structure. Here’s their mobile web, iOS apps, and Android apps screenshot for example:
    </p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/hamburger.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-three-quarters-width" src="assets/images/ux/hamburger.png"/></a></p>
    <p>The main benefit of using the icon + text structure is that it allows you to fit in all text while keeping the button size large enough to deal with the big thumbs.<br>
        If you must expand before 5 tabs, the common practice is to use the last tab bar to provide access to the remaining option, similar to the hamburger menu.<br>
        If your desktop apps have a more robust navigation menu, then take the most important elements of your websites and convert them into a tab bar. The other elements can still be available through “more” or “other” tabs. Product Hunt did something interesting with their navigation system. They use a text-based navigation on their mobile and called it “navigation” to replace the hamburger menu.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Other recommendations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>draw a clear line between modal-views and child-views and know when to use which</li>
        <li>only use modal-views for self-contained processes (and fullscreen detail-views in rare occasions)</li>
        <li>use child-views for everything else</li>
        <li>display the tab bar / bottom navigation on every view including child-views</li>
        <li>hide navigation bars (at the top of the screen) and tab bars (at the bottom of the screen) when scrolling down if you want to create focus and maximise screen estate (e.g. for articles, …)</li>

    <p>8 golden rules from Shneiderman +  Nielsen & Mochlich's heuristics = 10 rules of thumb </p>
    <ul>
        <li>visibility of sytem status</li>
        <li>match between system and the real world</li>
        <li>user control and freedom</li>
        <li>consistency and standards</li>

        <li>recognition rather than recall</li>
        <li>flexibility and effiency of use</li>
        <li>aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
        <li>help users recognise, diagnose and recover from error</li>
        <li>help and documentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These 10 rules of thumb should only generally be used to inform and inspire a designer’s and a company’s development of their own specific heuristics. In combination with market research, other design guidelines and requirements, using your company or product-specific heuristics will better suit the design under scrutiny</p>
    <p>How to Generate and Conduct Your Own Heuristic Evaluation</p>
    <ul>
        <li>establish an appropriate list of heuristics</li>
        <li>select your evaluators (they should not be your end users) they should have domain expertise</li>
        <li>brief your evaluators :  so they know exactly what they are meant to do and cover during their evaluation. The briefing session should be standardized to ensure the evaluators receive the same instructions; otherwise you may bias their evaluation. </li>
        <li>1st evaluation phase: it generally takes around two hours, depending on the nature and complexity of your product. The evaluators will use the product freely to gain a feel for the methods of interaction and the scope. They will then identify specific elements that they want to evaluate.</li>
        <li>2nd evaluation phase: the evaluators will carry out another run-through, whilst applying the chosen heuristics to the elements identified during the first phase. The evaluators would focus on individual elements and look at how well they fit in the overall design.</li>
        <li>record problems: The evaluators must record problems themselves or you should record them as they carry out their various tasks to track any problems they encounter.</li>
        <li>debriefing session: this involves collaboration between the different evaluators to collate their findings and establish a complete list of problems. They should then be encouraged to suggest potential solutions for these problems on the basis of the heuristics.</li>

    <p>5 Steps to Designing an Information Visualization<br>
            The overall process is simple and once you’ve reviewed the process, it should feel like common sense:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>define the problem</li>
        <li>define the data to be represented</li>
        <li>define the dimensions required to represent the data</li>
        <li>define the structures of the data</li>
        <li>define the interaction required from the visualisation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This process of how to design an information visualization is not concerned with your final output but rather enabling you to make an informed decision on what forms of representation might best serve your users. By understanding a user’s needs, the data to be displayed and the relationships in that data as well as the kind of model required; the information visualization designer can deliver a model which meets those needs.</p>

    <p><strong>UX design is more than interaction design:</strong> it also involves user research (finding out who the users are in the first place), creating user personas (why, and under what conditions, would they use the product), performing user testing and usability testing, etc.</p>
    <p>The 5 dimensions of interaction design is a useful model to understand what interaction design involves.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>words</strong> like button label, should be meaningful and simple to understand. They should communicate information to users, but not too much information to overwhelm the user.</li>
        <li><strong>visual representations</strong> graphical elements like images, typography and icons that users interact with. These usually supplement the words used to communicate information to users.</li>
        <li><strong>physical objects or space</strong> is the user standing in a crowded train while using the app on a smartphone, or sitting on a desk in the office surfing the website? These all affect the interaction between the user and the product.</li>
        <li><strong>time</strong> refers to media that changes with time (animation, videos, sounds). Motion and sounds play a crucial role in giving visual and audio feedback to users’ interactions. Also of concern is the amount of time a user spends interacting with the product: can users track their progress, or resume their interaction some time later?</li>
        <li><strong>behaviour</strong> how do users perform actions on the website? How do users operate the product? In other words, it’s how the previous dimensions define the interactions of a product. It also includes the reactions—for instance emotional responses or feedback—of users and the product.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Important questions interaction designers ask:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>what can a user do with their mouse, finger, or stylus to directly interact with the interface? </li>
        <li>what about the appearance (colour, shape, size, etc.) gives the user a clue about how it may function?</li>
        <li>do error messages provide a way for the user to correct the problem or explain why the error occurred?</li>
        <li>what feedback does a user get once an action is performed?</li>
        <li>are the interface elements a reasonable size to interact with?</li>
        <li>are familiar or standard formats used? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>What do interaction designers do? <br>
    Design strategy which can include doing your own UR>, wireframes that lay out the interactions of the product. In some cases, interactive prototypes are created.</p>

    <p>Show don't tell, and present as a story:<br>
        When interviewing for a job, you can make yourself shine by telling stories about your best design work. Hiring managers love hearing stories during an interview.<br>
        Stories show them how you put your skills to work. Telling a hiring manager what skills you have is usually less convincing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>scope Your Story Before the Interview</li>
            <li>Lead with the Bottom Line Up Front: you start with a brief, concise, and engaging summary of what you’re about to say. Then, you go into detail</li>
            <li>explain Results, Not Just Actions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Often asked:  “Tell me whatever you want about yourself in 5 minutes”.</p>
        <p>Prototyping is a basic skill for most companies, so expect and prepare answers on this. Do you prototype? Which tools have you used? High-fi, Low-fi? Do you prefer to start with a pencil and paper? Why (or why not)?</p>
        <p>They want to learn what sort of challenges you’ve had: how you approached a solution, the steps you followed building a complex prototype, the mistakes you made presenting results of a test, learnings, unexpected outcomes, etc. Have you ever had to park an idea because it was impossible to build/code? Pixel perfect designs look awesome in Sketch, and animations are mind blowing in FramerJS, but UX is also about translating brilliant ideas into executable design.</p>
        <p>How did you become a UX Designer? Did you study UX, or grow into UX Design from another discipline? Why did you pick UX Design and give up on what you were doing before (coding, designing, advertising, etc).</p>
        <p>Ask questions. It’s not only the simplest way to find out things about the company you are applying to, but also a priceless opportunity to connect with the person you’ll probably be working with 8 hours a day!</p>
        <p>Most managers often send a small assessment prior to this interview. It could be a heuristic evaluation of a given website, a fake hypothetical problem to solve, an analysis of a random feature on a website or something else. Sometimes I won’t send anything at all and instead do a live exercise and critique during the third interview using either Sketch or a whiteboard. <br>
            Although the output of the exercise itself is important, the intention of this panel interview is to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Validate your ability to breakdown a problem and explain design</li>
        <li>Assess how you interact with other people and the process you follow</li>
        <li>Check your points of view on disagreements over how your ideas solve business problems</li>
        <li>Your attention to detail, your analytical skills, your power to diverge and to assess how you think and if you think of the context when suggesting a solution, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before you start the process make sure you have a clear definition of what you do, what kind of designer you are and what kind of designer you want to be: Are you a Researcher + Designer, a Visual Designer, Interaction Designer? A Developer with a crush on UX? A Unicorn? (we love unicorns, if you are one just drop me a DM now ;). Maybe you are all about strategy, or love to conceptualise. There’s no right or unique answer. The UX Designer role is not standardised and varies from one company to another, so it’s important that you know what the company has to offer and what you can offer the company.</p>

    <p>Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) is a framework based on the idea that whenever users “hire” (i.e., use) a product, they do it for a specific “job” (i.e., to achieve a particular outcome). The set of “jobs” for the product amounts to a comprehensive list of user needs.</p>

    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/interfaces.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/interfaces.jpg"/></a></p>
    <p>An NUI is a user interface that feels natural to use because it fits the skills and context of the user. Below are the four guidelines for designing NUIs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an NUI should take advantage of the users’ existing skills and knowledge</li>
            <li>an NUI should have a clear learning path and allow both novice and expert users to interact in a natural way</li>
            <li>interaction with an NUI should be direct and fit the user’s context</li>
            <li>whenever possible, you should prioritize taking advantage of the user’s basic skills</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Remember, the proof of your NUI’s success will be a matter that users will decide for you in a very short time on accessing your design. So, keep their identity, needs and context in mind every step of the way. Just as importantly, stay mindful of how ‘clever’ an aspect of your NUI actually is—great design is about satisfying needs, not outsmarting users.</p>

    <h2>Personalisation</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/creepiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Creepiness–Convenience Tradeoff</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/guiding-principles-for-providing-remember-me-personalization/?item=ux-writing-the-case-for-user-centric-language%2F#/main/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Guiding Principles for Providing “Remember Me” Personalization</strong></a></p>
    <p>A three-pronged approach: examining our past user research, our customers, and our competition.</p>
    <p>Previous studies gave us insight into the way customers view their account information: specifically, <strong>what personal information they consider private, semi-private, or non-private</strong>.<br>
        We met with our in-house privacy expert and with a leading technology and market research company to understand what business issues might arise as a result of “remember me” personalization. They were unaware of companies facing legal problems resulting from privacy issues related to personalization; however, both experts acknowledged that some businesses have encountered challenges from a public relations perspective.<br>
        Finally, we studied how direct competitors, secondary competitors, and major sites outside our industry are using “remember me” personalization by performing a detailed competitive analysis. We discovered that choosing to be “remembered” means different things on different sites. At one end of the spectrum, it’s like an automatic sign in, enabling full access to account/personal information. The other end involves little more than a username pre-fill, allowing for quicker sign in.<br>    
        What <strong>we learned—it’s a jungle out there</strong>.We developed the Guiding Principles: general guidelines for creating “remember me” personalisation that’s effective both from the customer and business perspective.<br>
        <strong>We discovered that there are virtually no established standards or guidelines for “remember me” personalization.</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>The Guiding Principles</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Communicate openly and clearly about security and privacy</li>
            <p>Address customers’ concerns, and do it in context—for example, when they are signing in or being asked for information.</p>
            <p>Customers want to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How the site uses cookies, web pixels, and related technologies, explained in a way they understand.</li>
                <li>Why the site wants or requires personal information.</li>
                <li>What personal information is collected.</li>
                <li>What cookies are set and what these cookies are called.</li>
                <li>What is in each cookie.</li>
                <li>How personal information will be used by the site and third parties, and who these third parties are.</li>
                <li>How users can access their personal information.</li>
                <li>Options for controlling how personal information is used.</li>
                <li>How personal information will be protected.</li>            
            </ul> <br><br>

            <li>Explain the value of personalization to customers</li>
            <p>Customers should always get something from personalization, and the benefits should be proportional to the amount of personal information they provide. Make it clear what they will get in exchange for their personal information.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Build customer trust</li>
            <p>There are many ways to do this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How the site uses cookies, web pixels, and related technologies, explained in a way they understand</li>
                <li>Why the site wants or requires personal information</li>
                <li>What personal information is collected</li>
                <li>What cookies are set and what these cookies are called</li>
                <li>What is in each cookie</li>
                <li>How personal information will be used by the site and third parties, and who these third parties are.</li>
                <li>How users can access their personal information</li>
                <li>Options for controlling how personal information is used</li>
                <li>How personal information will be protected</li>
            </ul> <br><br>
           
            <li>Give customers flexibility and control</li>
            <p>Allow them to opt out of being remembered at any time. Make it clear how to do that and make it simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide well-marked paths and landmarks</li>
                <li>Offer reliable visual cues for context</li>
                <li>Keep them informed so they do not enter into an experience unwittingly</li>
                <li>Make actions reversible so they do not make irrecoverable changes</li>
                <li>Always allow a way out, but make it easier to stay in</li>
            </ul> <br><br>
 
            
            <li>Make customer participation in personalization seamless, but obvious</li>
            <p>Give customers options for personalizing content and gather information iteratively at appropriate times, offering feedback and “gentle reminders” prompting them to update personal information. Make it easy for them to provide information, but make sure that will be a conscious decision by the customer.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Provide personalization whenever possible, as long as it is relevant</li>

     <p>They hide the choices they represent. Users have to interact with the control before they know what they're being asked, which makes it harder to comprehend things at a glance.<br> 
        They're hard for some people to use. Less experienced users can struggle to use these controls, especially if they contain a lot of options - either they don't know how to interact with them, or they're unaware that they can scroll through the list.<br> 
        They can cause accessibility issues. On some devices the list of options cannot be zoomed, which means that some people with visual impairments cannot use them.

    <p><strong>What is Rapid Prototyping?</strong><br>
        It is not just wireframes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wireframes are the skeletal structure of user interfaces. It shows the structure, layout, content and functionality of a page.</li>
            <li>Rapid Prototyping is part of the design process after you have a clear grasp of the problem and your users’ needs. At this stage, the designer thinks about what needs to be done to reach the end goal and goes through a series of quick iterations and feedback sessions that could potentially solve the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What you see at the end of a rapid prototyping session are wireframes that you can use to demonstrate the idea but within these ‘wireframes’ are solutions.</p>
        <p>Sketches and rapid prototyping shows others how you think through problems. Your solutions should come to you through sketching, feedback and multiple design iterations.</p>

    <p>A toast component should deliver a concise message in the form of a positioned pop-up. Typically a toast message appears from the bottom of a screen or viewport, but this is often associated with small screen devices. A “growler” notification could also be considered a type of “toast”, and they may appear from a top or bottom corner of the screen or viewport. Regardless of positioning, whatever location is used it should remain consistent for all use of such messages.</p>
    <p>At a high level, toasts should be used to indicate the completion of a task or process initiated by the user or the application itself. For instance, a notification verifying the saving of a file, that a message had been properly sent, or a that a meeting was about to start.</p>
    <p>If someone were to ignore, or miss a toast message, due to its timed display, there should be no negative impact on their current activities or the status that the message conveyed. </p>

    <p>This is largely a qualitative activity. We usually have a small sample of users.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>time on task</li>
        <li>success/failure rates  <strong>(number one metric captured in UT)</strong> = ease of use</li>
        <li>do they get the task (success rate) do they not (failure rate), do they get part of it (partial success)</li>
        <li>effort: e.g. number of clicks / perception of progress</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Qualitative</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>stress responses (looking at their face, change in body language)</li>
        <li>subjective satisfaction (a questionnaire about how well they think they did)</li>
        <li>perceived effort or difficulty</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4 steps</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>create test plan: </strong>recruit the users, define the test scope, identify objectives, establish metrics</li>
        <li><strong>facilitate test: </strong>observe users, identify issues, identify solutions, interview users</li>
        <li><strong>analyse test data: </strong>assess user behaviour, analyse user click path. identify problem areas, assess navigation</li>
        <li><strong>create test report</strong>review video footage, identify design issues, identify best practices, design recommendations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why metrics: </p>

        <li>missing a rule</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Usability Testing and Moderating Skills Why do we test by scenario?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>more realism with real world behaviour</li>
        <li>to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for the test participant</li>
        <li>so we don't give away what we are testing</li>
        <li>so <strong>we don't lead the witness</strong>, we need to be a bit obscure and not use the vocabulary of the product</li>
        <li>scenario simulate real-life the closest</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conduct a pilot test:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>always conduct a live fire test the day before to iron out any issues</li>
        <li>for mobile testing: always test reception in the room or the area you will be testing in </li>
        <li>make sure lightning is ok for the screen of the device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why think aloud? </strong>Asking users to think aloud helps you track their thought patterns. This becomes the running commentary on task performance (which you observe and take notes on). Remind them that we are testing the interface, not them. </p>
    <p>We are observers, we do not talk. Even if the user is asking us something, if we do not respond they will usually move on. We can say ok, or uh huh, but not good or bad. Need to stay neutral. You can use reverse questions (is this what you were expecting?).</p>

        <li>who you tested with (one slide)</li>
        <li>what the task were (one slide)</li>
        <li>results: bug one slide, usability problem (3 - 4 slides) - Try to avoid suggesting any solutions here.

    <p>User-centered design creates a unique chance to design together with communities. User-centered designers deeply understand the folks they’re trying to serve. They create lots of ideas and make innovative new products rooted in people’s actual needs.</p>
    <p>To design in a user-centric way identify the people who will use the product, what they’ll use it for, and the conditions under which they will use it. Observe people’s lives, hear their hopes and needs, and get smart about your challenge.</p>
    <p><strong>User-centered design process goes through six phases:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>specify the use context and users’ needs</li>
        <li>specify business requirements</li>
        <li>build design solutions from rough concept to finished design</li>
        <li>evaluate designs with usability testing</li>
        <li>implementation — develop and deliver the product</li>
        <li>deployment — the final product is evaluated, as consumer needs change</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Responsive principles of user-centered design:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>clear understanding of the users, tasks and environments</li>
        <li>evaluation-driven design</li>
        <li>considering the general consumer experience</li>
        <li>involving the client within the design process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>User-centered designers test, fail and try once more. This method combines analysis, interviews, generative strategies, and tools like group action. UCD, for the most part, develops an understanding of the user’s desires through the inclusion of users at all stages of the designing and testing. We rely on feedback from everybody in the group. Iteration keeps design process responsive.</p>
    <p>In user-centered design, you have to be comfortable with the idea of failure and celebrate the learning which it brings. You try something out, maybe pushing too far, or you want to learn from an experiment. And your half-baked idea didn’t quite work out how you expected. But in some ways, <strong>the learning that came from that unexpected failure was more valuable than the success might have been.</strong></p>
    <p>When it comes to implementation, that’s when you don’t want quite as much failure to happen. Because <dtrong>the process starts getting more expensive</dtrong>. You’ll be putting all your effort into making something. But even then you need to be constantly experimenting and refining. So <strong>with user-centered design even in case of failure you continue to prototype and improve your UX. With user-centered desig</strong>n, you will not have avoidable rework or even worse a big failure right at the end. Because UCD identifies problems before they emerge.</p>

    <h2>UI</h2>
    <p>Simply put, UI is how things look, UX is how things work. UX is a process, while UI is a deliverable.</p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/notes/notes_UI_patterns.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>My notes from IDF course (30 pages!)</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ui.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/ui.png"/></a><a href="assets/images/ux/ui2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/ui2.png"/></a></p>
    <p>As a UI designer, your goal is to create a user interface that is engaging, beautiful, and also creates an emotional response from the user to make your products more lovable and beautiful.</p>
    <p>When I started out, something I learned from my mentor is to take a tour guide journey to your product. Imagine your app/website as a journey. Every user that downloads your app right from spotting it in the App Store/web, through using it, achieving goals or completing tasks within the app is taken on a journey. And that journey should be a delightful one.</p>
    <p><strong>Alignment</strong> is a fundamental aspect of UI Design. And an important design principle is: minimize the number of alignment lines. It improves readibility and makes the design more pleasing to the eye.<br>
        There are two fundamental types of alignment: Edge alignment and Center alignment.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>edge alignment: all the elements having one side or edge lining up with a single line</li>
        <li>center alignment: you line up all the elements by their midpoint</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Become an attention architect.</strong>Here’s two ways to interpret this: you need to </p>
    <ol>
        <li>grab the user’s attention with your design</li>
        <li>pay attention to every little thing in your designs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To be a great designer, you need to do both. The latter lets you achieve the former.</p>
    <p>UI Design is about tailoring the experience for your users by guiding their attention towards different important things.</p>
    <p class="lead">Ways to use text to grab user’s attention:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>make its size larger or smaller</li>
        <li>bolder or brighter in color. Or make it muted</li>
        <li>use a typeface with a heavy weighting versus something that is thin or light</li>
        <li>italicize words. Capitalise or lowercase some words</li>
        <li>increase the distance between each of the letters to make the overall size of the words take up more space</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most important thing when designing is testing! Make sure you try out different everything: colors, fonts, tones, angles, alignment, layout, etc. Experiment with different designs so that you can architect a user journey using various ways of commanding attention.</p>

    <p><strong>Call-to-action buttons</strong> are one of the most powerful sales tools in e-commerce and an influential factor of good conversion of a page or screen.

    <p class="lead">From The non-Designer Design Book:</p>
    <p>4 basic principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: avoid elements on the page that are merely similar. If the elements (type colour, size, line thickness, shape, space etc) are not the same, then make them very different. Contrast is often the most important visual attraction on a page. It clarifies the communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: you can repeat colours, shapes, textures, spatial relationships, line thickness, fonts, sizes, graphic concepts etc. This develops the organisation and strengthnes the unity. Consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page. This creates a clean and sophisticated look.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: items relating to each other should be grouped close together. When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. This helps organise information, reduces clutter and gives the reader a clear structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Voice User Interface design is a promising brand new field which provides solutions through voice control. With VUI and GUI combined, human-machine interaction can be enhanced and streamlined using input via facial expressions, gestures, and audio.</p>
    <p>Combining GUI and VUI presents challenges:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>coordinate voice and gesture input</li>
            <li>determine whether to speak or display</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Combining GUI and VUI has benefits:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>leverage advantages of both GUI and VUI</li>
            <li>user convenience</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Plan and develop carefully:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>user test, test, and test some more</li>
        </ul>
