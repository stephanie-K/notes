   <p>For service ecosystems that are primarily digital in nature, you’ll find that a good UX team will be able to bring everything together.<br>
    For services where the digital experience is just one of a number of touchpoints, having a Service Designer orchestrate those touchpoints makes a lot of sense. </p>
    <p>Service Designers tend to have a broader but shallower focus, while UX designers go narrower but deeper.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>usability</strong>: A measure of a user’s ability to arrive on a site, use it easily, and complete the desired task</li>
        <li><strong>useful content</strong>: The website should include enough information in an easily digestible format that users can make informed decisions</li>
        <li><strong>desirable/pleasurable content</strong>: The best user experiences come when the user can form an emotional bond with the product or website</li>
        <li><strong>accessibility</strong>: For people with different levels of disability, online experiences can be deeply frustrating. </li>
        <li><strong>credibility</strong>: The trust that your website engenders in your users also plays a part in the user experience. One of the biggest concerns users have online is security (in many cases, they worry about privacy, too)</li>

    <h3>80/20 The Pareto principle</h3>
    <p>A Management Consultant Joseph M Juran back in the 1940s. He noticed that there is a general rule in business and in life – that 80% of the effects of a process come from just 20% of the inputs. He named this principle the “Pareto Principle” after the Italian Economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923).<br>
        The Pareto Principle is useful because it allows us to focus our efforts on the areas that bring the most rewards. It’s used in almost every business discipline. For example, sales people will note that 20% of their accounts bring 80% of their sales.
    </p>
    <p>It’s important to note that 80%/20% is not exact. <strong> What is almost always true is that a small proportion of the efforts (inputs) will generate a larger than expected level of results (outputs).</strong>
        It doesn’t matter how complex your website or application is, you will find that when you dig down into user analytics – the Pareto Principle will come into play. A small fraction of the functionality (or pages) will receive the majority of user time; this doesn’t mean that the rest of the functionality or content has no value but it does mean that some functionality and content is more important to the majority of your users than some of the rest.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The Pareto Principle or 80-20 Rule can be very effective in helping you make decisions in your user experience work. </strong>From research and analytics to higher level stuff like project management, wherever there is data that can be quantified there’s the possibility that you can use this rule to focus your efforts on the areas of your work that bring the most results.<br>
        However, you always need to be mindful of sample sizes and of other forms of data which may override the Pareto Principle in practice.

    <p>At its core, A/B testing is exactly what it sounds like: you have two versions of an element (A and B) and a metric that defines success. To determine which version is better, you subject both versions to experimentation simultaneously. In the end, you measure which version was more successful and select that version for real-world use.</p>
    <p>If you change more than one variable, this is multivariate testing and need a lot of traffic to your website to be used</p>

    <p>Identifying good vs. bad feedback:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bad feedback focuses on the solution, and not the problem</li>
        <li>Bad feedback includes personal likes and dislikes</li>
        <li>Bad feedback is directed to the designer, not to the design</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A good way to prevent bad feedback of coming up in the first place is to start every meeting with a recap of the goals. What are we trying to achieve here? Where are we in the process? What feedback are we expecting to discuss today?</p>
    <p>Discussing the feedback you received:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Listen more than you speak</li>
        <li>Ask for clarification</li>
        <li>Write down the feedback</li>
        <li>Create scenarios</li>
        <li>Push for consensus<br>
            It’s common that two people will hijack design critique sessions to discuss a specific point, but it is important for the designer to make sure other participants also agree with what’s being discussed. What you don’t want is to make a change based on what one of your peers/clients thinks, and then have the new version be disliked by someone else who was quiet the first time

    <p>A sitemap footer has the ability to minimize the efforts users need to take in navigating through a website. When you design clear and distinct links and place them in the footer at the bottom of the page, you allow users to explore other sections or navigate directly to relevant information, without having to return to the top of the page and navigate through the entire hierarchy. When implemented successfully, footers can take some of the pressure off the global navigation bar at the top of the page, resulting in a less cluttered and more appealing interface. Better still, if you use them consistently, they will serve as reassuring beacons for where to go next, thus lubricating the user’s journey to make it more seamless while helping optimize the whole experience.</p>

    <h3>Hamburger menu (or navigation drawer)</h3>

    <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/tab-bars-are-the-new-hamburger-menus-9138891e98f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tab bars are the new hamburger menus</strong></a></p>
    <ol>
        <li>it clashes with the platform navigation pattern</li>
        <li>hamburger menu lacks efficiency (top left hard to reach on a small screen)</li>
        <li>unclear information architecture</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Navigation Goals</strong>, it has to tell a user three things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>where am I?</li>
        <li>where else can I go</li>
        <li>what will I find when I get there?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Review your Information Architecture:</strong><br>
        Do a user research by using card sorting method. Let your users categorize your IA based on their intuition and their “information scents” to know more on what the users want and how they would like to use the apps. After you did a little research, then you can start building your new IA for your apps.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Start using tab bars:</strong><br>
        So far, the best solution for mobile apps seems to be a tab bar. Either you place it on the top or the bottom of the screen. (It’s up to you where you want to put it. But it would best to put it on top if you are designing for responsive web). When you have your new IA, you can prioritize to use 4–5 icon + text button for your primary navigation options. This is the approach that Facebook has settled for their mobile apps and their apps navigation structure. Here’s their mobile web, iOS apps, and Android apps screenshot for example:
    </p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/hamburger.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-three-quarters-width" src="assets/images/ux/hamburger.png"/></a></p>
    <p>The main benefit of using the icon + text structure is that it allows you to fit in all text while keeping the button size large enough to deal with the big thumbs.<br>
        If you must expand before 5 tabs, the common practice is to use the last tab bar to provide access to the remaining option, similar to the hamburger menu.<br>
        If your desktop apps have a more robust navigation menu, then take the most important elements of your websites and convert them into a tab bar. The other elements can still be available through “more” or “other” tabs. Product Hunt did something interesting with their navigation system. They use a text-based navigation on their mobile and called it “navigation” to replace the hamburger menu.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Other recommendations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>draw a clear line between modal-views and child-views and know when to use which</li>
        <li>only use modal-views for self-contained processes (and fullscreen detail-views in rare occasions)</li>
        <li>use child-views for everything else</li>
        <li>display the tab bar / bottom navigation on every view including child-views</li>
        <li>hide navigation bars (at the top of the screen) and tab bars (at the bottom of the screen) when scrolling down if you want to create focus and maximise screen estate (e.g. for articles, …)</li>

    <p>8 golden rules from Shneiderman +  Nielsen & Mochlich's heuristics = 10 rules of thumb </p>
    <ul>
        <li>visibility of sytem status</li>
        <li>match between system and the real world</li>
        <li>user control and freedom</li>
        <li>consistency and standards</li>
        <li>error prevention</li>
        <li>recognition rather than recall</li>
        <li>flexibility and effiency of use</li>
        <li>aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
        <li>help users recognise, diagnose and recover from error</li>
        <li>help and documentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These 10 rules of thumb should only generally be used to inform and inspire a designer’s and a company’s development of their own specific heuristics. In combination with market research, other design guidelines and requirements, using your company or product-specific heuristics will better suit the design under scrutiny</p>
    <p>How to Generate and Conduct Your Own Heuristic Evaluation</p>
    <ul>
        <li>establish an appropriate list of heuristics</li>
        <li>select your evaluators (they should not be your end users) they should have domain expertise</li>
        <li>brief your evaluators :  so they know exactly what they are meant to do and cover during their evaluation. The briefing session should be standardized to ensure the evaluators receive the same instructions; otherwise you may bias their evaluation. </li>
        <li>1st evaluation phase: it generally takes around two hours, depending on the nature and complexity of your product. The evaluators will use the product freely to gain a feel for the methods of interaction and the scope. They will then identify specific elements that they want to evaluate.</li>
        <li>2nd evaluation phase: the evaluators will carry out another run-through, whilst applying the chosen heuristics to the elements identified during the first phase. The evaluators would focus on individual elements and look at how well they fit in the overall design.</li>
        <li>record problems: The evaluators must record problems themselves or you should record them as they carry out their various tasks to track any problems they encounter.</li>
        <li>debriefing session: this involves collaboration between the different evaluators to collate their findings and establish a complete list of problems. They should then be encouraged to suggest potential solutions for these problems on the basis of the heuristics.</li>

    <h3>Information visualisation</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-design-an-information-visualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>How to Design an Information Visualisation</strong></a></p>
    <p>5 Steps to Designing an Information Visualization<br>
            The overall process is simple and once you’ve reviewed the process, it should feel like common sense:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>define the problem</li>
        <li>define the data to be represented</li>
        <li>define the dimensions required to represent the data</li>
        <li>define the structures of the data</li>
        <li>define the interaction required from the visualisation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This process of how to design an information visualization is not concerned with your final output but rather enabling you to make an informed decision on what forms of representation might best serve your users. By understanding a user’s needs, the data to be displayed and the relationships in that data as well as the kind of model required; the information visualization designer can deliver a model which meets those needs.</p>

    <h3>Interaction design</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-interaction-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>What is Interaction Design?</strong></a></p>
    <p>It is the design of the interaction between users and products. The goal of interaction design is to create products that enable the user to achieve their objective(s) in the best way possible.</p>
    <p><strong>UX design is more than interaction design:</strong> it also involves user research (finding out who the users are in the first place), creating user personas (why, and under what conditions, would they use the product), performing user testing and usability testing, etc.</p>
    <p>The 5 dimensions of interaction design is a useful model to understand what interaction design involves.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>words</strong> like button label, should be meaningful and simple to understand. They should communicate information to users, but not too much information to overwhelm the user.</li>
        <li><strong>visual representations</strong> graphical elements like images, typography and icons that users interact with. These usually supplement the words used to communicate information to users.</li>
        <li><strong>physical objects or space</strong> is the user standing in a crowded train while using the app on a smartphone, or sitting on a desk in the office surfing the website? These all affect the interaction between the user and the product.</li>
        <li><strong>time</strong> refers to media that changes with time (animation, videos, sounds). Motion and sounds play a crucial role in giving visual and audio feedback to users’ interactions. Also of concern is the amount of time a user spends interacting with the product: can users track their progress, or resume their interaction some time later?</li>
        <li><strong>behaviour</strong> how do users perform actions on the website? How do users operate the product? In other words, it’s how the previous dimensions define the interactions of a product. It also includes the reactions—for instance emotional responses or feedback—of users and the product.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/5D.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/5D.gif"/></a></p>
    <p>Important questions interaction designers ask:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>what can a user do with their mouse, finger, or stylus to directly interact with the interface? </li>
        <li>what about the appearance (colour, shape, size, etc.) gives the user a clue about how it may function?</li>
        <li>do error messages provide a way for the user to correct the problem or explain why the error occurred?</li>
        <li>what feedback does a user get once an action is performed?</li>
        <li>are the interface elements a reasonable size to interact with?</li>
        <li>are familiar or standard formats used? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>What do interaction designers do? <br>
    Design strategy which can include doing your own UR>, wireframes that lay out the interactions of the product. In some cases, interactive prototypes are created.</p>

    <h3>Interview</h3>

    <p>Show don't tell, and present as a story:<br>
        When interviewing for a job, you can make yourself shine by telling stories about your best design work. Hiring managers love hearing stories during an interview.<br>
        Stories show them how you put your skills to work. Telling a hiring manager what skills you have is usually less convincing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>scope Your Story Before the Interview</li>
            <li>Lead with the Bottom Line Up Front: you start with a brief, concise, and engaging summary of what you’re about to say. Then, you go into detail</li>
            <li>explain Results, Not Just Actions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Often asked:  “Tell me whatever you want about yourself in 5 minutes”.</p>
        <p>Prototyping is a basic skill for most companies, so expect and prepare answers on this. Do you prototype? Which tools have you used? High-fi, Low-fi? Do you prefer to start with a pencil and paper? Why (or why not)?</p>
        <p>They want to learn what sort of challenges you’ve had: how you approached a solution, the steps you followed building a complex prototype, the mistakes you made presenting results of a test, learnings, unexpected outcomes, etc. Have you ever had to park an idea because it was impossible to build/code? Pixel perfect designs look awesome in Sketch, and animations are mind blowing in FramerJS, but UX is also about translating brilliant ideas into executable design.</p>
        <p>How did you become a UX Designer? Did you study UX, or grow into UX Design from another discipline? Why did you pick UX Design and give up on what you were doing before (coding, designing, advertising, etc).</p>
        <p>Ask questions. It’s not only the simplest way to find out things about the company you are applying to, but also a priceless opportunity to connect with the person you’ll probably be working with 8 hours a day!</p>
        <p>Most managers often send a small assessment prior to this interview. It could be a heuristic evaluation of a given website, a fake hypothetical problem to solve, an analysis of a random feature on a website or something else. Sometimes I won’t send anything at all and instead do a live exercise and critique during the third interview using either Sketch or a whiteboard. <br>
            Although the output of the exercise itself is important, the intention of this panel interview is to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Validate your ability to breakdown a problem and explain design</li>
        <li>Assess how you interact with other people and the process you follow</li>
        <li>Check your points of view on disagreements over how your ideas solve business problems</li>
        <li>Your attention to detail, your analytical skills, your power to diverge and to assess how you think and if you think of the context when suggesting a solution, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before you start the process make sure you have a clear definition of what you do, what kind of designer you are and what kind of designer you want to be: Are you a Researcher + Designer, a Visual Designer, Interaction Designer? A Developer with a crush on UX? A Unicorn? (we love unicorns, if you are one just drop me a DM now ;). Maybe you are all about strategy, or love to conceptualise. There’s no right or unique answer. The UX Designer role is not standardised and varies from one company to another, so it’s important that you know what the company has to offer and what you can offer the company.</p>

        <li>not logged in</li>
        <li>logged in</li>
    </ul></p>

    
    <p> Amazon has an extra one:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>identified & not logged In (from a cookie left on my machine)</li>
        <li><strong>one click</strong> unabled (even though I didn't put my password, I can make a purchase - no authorisation needed)</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p><strong>Identify:</strong> Who are you?<br>
    <strong>Authorise:</strong> do you have permission?<br>
    <strong>Authenticate:</strong> are you who you say you are?</p>

    <p><strong>Design is the rendering of intent</strong><br>
    We can thoughtfully split up: identification, authorisation and authentication to reduce the friction in our SUX experience.</p>

    <p>Amazon created different threat models: How much security do we request at different points in the journey depending on the user's intent.</p>

    <p>In a car, the seat belt put the burden on the user vs an airbag which works only if you need it: it embeds the burden in the system.</p>

    <p>Safety is a burden. If you place it on the user, it creates frustration and is prone to accident.<br>
    If you place it on the system, it's more expensive and requires innovation.</p>
    
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/sux3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/sux3.png"/></a></p>

    <p>The designer's choice is:<br>
    Place the burden on our users or embed it into our systems?</p>

    <p><strong>Smart security perimeters postpone UX friction to the last possible moments.</strong></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/sux4.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/sux4.png"/></a></p>

    <p>The top reasons we continue to ignore SUX:<br>
    "This is what we've always done"<br>
    "This is how everyone else does it"</p>

   <p> Hacking a 15 characters password takes about 3 to 4 days in a brute force attack. But a phishing attack takes only 1 minutes, so having a strong password is not really a protection.</p>

    <p>Just assume passwords will never make your system secure.</p>

    <p>Two-factor authentication is better:
    <ul>
        <li>something you know (password)</li>
        <li>something you have (device, key)</li>
        <li>something you are (biometrics)</li>
    </ul></p>


    <p>As a user I want to log in ..... <strong>this is not a real user story</strong>, no one wants to log in in itself</p>

    <p>"UR shows users not reading the password rules on screen because they will use the password they usually use anyway and if it doesn't work they will swear"</p>

    <p>More and more users are using "password reset" as their password, <strong>"just send me a link!". It's the default option on Slack.</strong></p>

    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/interfaces.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/interfaces.jpg"/></a></p>
    <p>An NUI is a user interface that feels natural to use because it fits the skills and context of the user. Below are the four guidelines for designing NUIs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an NUI should take advantage of the users’ existing skills and knowledge</li>
            <li>an NUI should have a clear learning path and allow both novice and expert users to interact in a natural way</li>
            <li>interaction with an NUI should be direct and fit the user’s context</li>
            <li>whenever possible, you should prioritize taking advantage of the user’s basic skills</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Remember, the proof of your NUI’s success will be a matter that users will decide for you in a very short time on accessing your design. So, keep their identity, needs and context in mind every step of the way. Just as importantly, stay mindful of how ‘clever’ an aspect of your NUI actually is—great design is about satisfying needs, not outsmarting users.</p>

    <h3>Personalisation</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/creepiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Creepiness–Convenience Tradeoff</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/guiding-principles-for-providing-remember-me-personalization/?item=ux-writing-the-case-for-user-centric-language%2F#/main/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Guiding Principles for Providing “Remember Me” Personalization</strong></a></p>
    <p>A three-pronged approach: examining our past user research, our customers, and our competition.</p>
    <p>Previous studies gave us insight into the way customers view their account information: specifically, <strong>what personal information they consider private, semi-private, or non-private</strong>.<br>
        We met with our in-house privacy expert and with a leading technology and market research company to understand what business issues might arise as a result of “remember me” personalization. They were unaware of companies facing legal problems resulting from privacy issues related to personalization; however, both experts acknowledged that some businesses have encountered challenges from a public relations perspective.<br>
        Finally, we studied how direct competitors, secondary competitors, and major sites outside our industry are using “remember me” personalization by performing a detailed competitive analysis. We discovered that choosing to be “remembered” means different things on different sites. At one end of the spectrum, it’s like an automatic sign in, enabling full access to account/personal information. The other end involves little more than a username pre-fill, allowing for quicker sign in.<br>    
        What <strong>we learned—it’s a jungle out there</strong>.We developed the Guiding Principles: general guidelines for creating “remember me” personalisation that’s effective both from the customer and business perspective.<br>
        <strong>We discovered that there are virtually no established standards or guidelines for “remember me” personalization.</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>The Guiding Principles</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Communicate openly and clearly about security and privacy</li>
            <p>Address customers’ concerns, and do it in context—for example, when they are signing in or being asked for information.</p>
            <p>Customers want to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How the site uses cookies, web pixels, and related technologies, explained in a way they understand.</li>
                <li>Why the site wants or requires personal information.</li>
                <li>What personal information is collected.</li>
                <li>What cookies are set and what these cookies are called.</li>
                <li>What is in each cookie.</li>
                <li>How personal information will be used by the site and third parties, and who these third parties are.</li>
                <li>How users can access their personal information.</li>
                <li>Options for controlling how personal information is used.</li>
                <li>How personal information will be protected.</li>            
            </ul> <br><br>

            <li>Explain the value of personalization to customers</li>
            <p>Customers should always get something from personalization, and the benefits should be proportional to the amount of personal information they provide. Make it clear what they will get in exchange for their personal information.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Build customer trust</li>
            <p>There are many ways to do this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How the site uses cookies, web pixels, and related technologies, explained in a way they understand</li>
                <li>Why the site wants or requires personal information</li>
                <li>What personal information is collected</li>
                <li>What cookies are set and what these cookies are called</li>
                <li>What is in each cookie</li>
                <li>How personal information will be used by the site and third parties, and who these third parties are.</li>
                <li>How users can access their personal information</li>
                <li>Options for controlling how personal information is used</li>
                <li>How personal information will be protected</li>
            </ul> <br><br>
           
            <li>Give customers flexibility and control</li>
            <p>Allow them to opt out of being remembered at any time. Make it clear how to do that and make it simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide well-marked paths and landmarks</li>
                <li>Offer reliable visual cues for context</li>
                <li>Keep them informed so they do not enter into an experience unwittingly</li>
                <li>Make actions reversible so they do not make irrecoverable changes</li>
                <li>Always allow a way out, but make it easier to stay in</li>
            </ul> <br><br>
 
            
            <li>Make customer participation in personalization seamless, but obvious</li>
            <p>Give customers options for personalizing content and gather information iteratively at appropriate times, offering feedback and “gentle reminders” prompting them to update personal information. Make it easy for them to provide information, but make sure that will be a conscious decision by the customer.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Provide personalization whenever possible, as long as it is relevant</li>
            <p>Use personalization to enhance the customer’s relationship with the site, and keep it in the context of what the customer is doing while on the site. Ensure that “remember me” personalization supports the mission and purpose of the website.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Test “remember me” functionality to ensure it works and is usable</li>
            <p>Make sure the functionality works the way it’s supposed to.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide clear visual and verbal cues that reveal the customer’s status: remembered, signed in, or not recognized</li>
                <li>Make sure visual and verbal cues match the site’s performance, i.e., no “sign out” link for “cookied” customers because they are not signed in</li>
                <li>Differentiate the “remember me” feature from sign in</li>
            </ul> <br><br>
            <li>Make sure that “remember me” personalization provides good ROI before implementing</li>
            <p>Check with customers to ensure that personalization you provide has value, and to determine ways to improve it. Review site statistics related to use of personalization, such as the number of users who check “remember me.” When planning enhancements to personalization, set metrics and then track results.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Before providing personalization, consult with the legal department</li>
            <p>Know the company’s policies regarding personal information and be aware of any past situations involving the company or the company’s industry that may have caused legal problems. Watch for emerging guidelines and best practices related to personalization.</p>

     <p>They hide the choices they represent. Users have to interact with the control before they know what they're being asked, which makes it harder to comprehend things at a glance.<br> 
        They're hard for some people to use. Less experienced users can struggle to use these controls, especially if they contain a lot of options - either they don't know how to interact with them, or they're unaware that they can scroll through the list.<br> 
        They can cause accessibility issues. On some devices the list of options cannot be zoomed, which means that some people with visual impairments cannot use them.

    <p><strong>What is Rapid Prototyping?</strong><br>
        It is not just wireframes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wireframes are the skeletal structure of user interfaces. It shows the structure, layout, content and functionality of a page.</li>
            <li>Rapid Prototyping is part of the design process after you have a clear grasp of the problem and your users’ needs. At this stage, the designer thinks about what needs to be done to reach the end goal and goes through a series of quick iterations and feedback sessions that could potentially solve the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What you see at the end of a rapid prototyping session are wireframes that you can use to demonstrate the idea but within these ‘wireframes’ are solutions.</p>
        <p>Sketches and rapid prototyping shows others how you think through problems. Your solutions should come to you through sketching, feedback and multiple design iterations.</p>

    <p>They are great when you start to explore ideas. This is a vital design tool because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They're cheap</li>
        <li>Help uou explore</li>
        <li>they forestall perfectionism</li>
        <li>they invite conceptual feedback</li>
        <li>they engage others</li>
        <li>Anyone can do it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You need to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with the right equipment: paper and pen</li>
        <li>Block off some time</li>
        <li>Sketch your first ideas for key parts of the experience</li>
        <li>Sketch alternatives, like up to 6 different way or showing something </li>
        <li>pick the best ideas once the exploration is finished and develop further</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A toast component should deliver a concise message in the form of a positioned pop-up. Typically a toast message appears from the bottom of a screen or viewport, but this is often associated with small screen devices. A “growler” notification could also be considered a type of “toast”, and they may appear from a top or bottom corner of the screen or viewport. Regardless of positioning, whatever location is used it should remain consistent for all use of such messages.</p>
    <p>At a high level, toasts should be used to indicate the completion of a task or process initiated by the user or the application itself. For instance, a notification verifying the saving of a file, that a message had been properly sent, or a that a meeting was about to start.</p>
    <p>If someone were to ignore, or miss a toast message, due to its timed display, there should be no negative impact on their current activities or the status that the message conveyed. </p>

    <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-build-a-usability-lab-anytime-anywhere-c7cef1c017be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>How to build a usability lab anytime, anywhere</strong></a></p>

    <p>This is largely a qualitative activity. We usually have a small sample of users.</p>
    <p><strong>Quantitative</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>time on task</li>
        <li>success/failure rates  <strong>(number one metric captured in UT)</strong> = ease of use</li>
        <li>do they get the task (success rate) do they not (failure rate), do they get part of it (partial success)</li>
        <li>effort: e.g. number of clicks / perception of progress</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Qualitative</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>stress responses (looking at their face, change in body language)</li>
        <li>subjective satisfaction (a questionnaire about how well they think they did)</li>
        <li>perceived effort or difficulty</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4 steps</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>create test plan: </strong>recruit the users, define the test scope, identify objectives, establish metrics</li>
        <li><strong>facilitate test: </strong>observe users, identify issues, identify solutions, interview users</li>
        <li><strong>analyse test data: </strong>assess user behaviour, analyse user click path. identify problem areas, assess navigation</li>
        <li><strong>create test report</strong>review video footage, identify design issues, identify best practices, design recommendations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why metrics: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>very important to have data to convince the rest of the team of stakeholder</li>
        <li>make usability recommendations concrete</li>
        <li>ground teams in reality</li>
        <li>help iterate and validate design concepts</li>
        <li>provide objectivity to design debates</li>
        <li>guide fact-based design decision</li>
    </ul>
    <p>usability issues</p>
    <ul>
        <li>not seeing something</li>
        <li>going in the wrong direction</li>
        <li>thinking ti's correct when it's not</li>
        <li>missing a rule</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Usability Testing and Moderating Skills Why do we test by scenario?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>more realism with real world behaviour</li>
        <li>to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for the test participant</li>
        <li>so we don't give away what we are testing</li>
        <li>so <strong>we don't lead the witness</strong>, we need to be a bit obscure and not use the vocabulary of the product</li>
        <li>scenario simulate real-life the closest</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conduct a pilot test:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>always conduct a live fire test the day before to iron out any issues</li>
        <li>for mobile testing: always test reception in the room or the area you will be testing in </li>
        <li>make sure lightning is ok for the screen of the device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why think aloud? </strong>Asking users to think aloud helps you track their thought patterns. This becomes the running commentary on task performance (which you observe and take notes on). Remind them that we are testing the interface, not them. </p>
    <p>We are observers, we do not talk. Even if the user is asking us something, if we do not respond they will usually move on. We can say ok, or uh huh, but not good or bad. Need to stay neutral. You can use reverse questions (is this what you were expecting?).</p>

    <p>Keep it short (under 10 pages or slides) and if possible online so people can always find it</p>
    <ul>
        <li>summary of key findings (one slide)</li>
        <li>who you tested with (one slide)</li>
        <li>what the task were (one slide)</li>
        <li>results: bug one slide, usability problem (3 - 4 slides) - Try to avoid suggesting any solutions here. This report is a place to clearly state what you observed in the user tests and so you have a record of how the website performed at that time. Even if they seem obvious, solutions should be separate from this.</li>
        <li>try to order the issues by severity</li>
        <li>other feedback (1 to 2 slides) other than bug or suability issue, try to put the positive too, general behaviour from the user</li>
        <li>post test questions (1 to 2 slides) your chance to gather a bit more from the users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Have the 'user advocacy' attitude:</p>

    <p>Gathering feedback is a crucial element in the Design Thinking process – and in all other human-centred design processes. In order to maximise the benefits of gathering feedback, however, you need to be purposeful about it. Here are some pointers to take note of when thinking about gathering feedback from your users.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ways to solicit feedback</li>
        <li>test your prototypes on the right people</li>
        <li>ask the right questions</li>
        <li>be neutral when presenting your ideas</li>
        <li>adapt while testing</li>
        <li>let the user contribute ideas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3 methods for maximising learning from testing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>feedback capture grid</li>

    <h3>User Centered Design</h3>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ucd.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/ucd.png"/></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/user-centered-design-process-and-benefits-fd9e431eb5a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>User-Centered Design: Process and Benefits</strong></a></p>
    <p>User-centered design creates a unique chance to design together with communities. User-centered designers deeply understand the folks they’re trying to serve. They create lots of ideas and make innovative new products rooted in people’s actual needs.</p>
    <p>To design in a user-centric way identify the people who will use the product, what they’ll use it for, and the conditions under which they will use it. Observe people’s lives, hear their hopes and needs, and get smart about your challenge.</p>
    <p><strong>User-centered design process goes through six phases:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>specify the use context and users’ needs</li>
        <li>specify business requirements</li>
        <li>build design solutions from rough concept to finished design</li>
        <li>evaluate designs with usability testing</li>
        <li>implementation — develop and deliver the product</li>
        <li>deployment — the final product is evaluated, as consumer needs change</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Responsive principles of user-centered design:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>clear understanding of the users, tasks and environments</li>
        <li>evaluation-driven design</li>
        <li>considering the general consumer experience</li>
        <li>involving the client within the design process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>User-centered designers test, fail and try once more. This method combines analysis, interviews, generative strategies, and tools like group action. UCD, for the most part, develops an understanding of the user’s desires through the inclusion of users at all stages of the designing and testing. We rely on feedback from everybody in the group. Iteration keeps design process responsive.</p>
    <p>In user-centered design, you have to be comfortable with the idea of failure and celebrate the learning which it brings. You try something out, maybe pushing too far, or you want to learn from an experiment. And your half-baked idea didn’t quite work out how you expected. But in some ways, <strong>the learning that came from that unexpected failure was more valuable than the success might have been.</strong></p>
    <p>When it comes to implementation, that’s when you don’t want quite as much failure to happen. Because <dtrong>the process starts getting more expensive</dtrong>. You’ll be putting all your effort into making something. But even then you need to be constantly experimenting and refining. So <strong>with user-centered design even in case of failure you continue to prototype and improve your UX. With user-centered desig</strong>n, you will not have avoidable rework or even worse a big failure right at the end. Because UCD identifies problems before they emerge.</p>

    <h3>UI</h3>
    <p>Simply put, UI is how things look, UX is how things work. UX is a process, while UI is a deliverable.</p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/notes/notes_UI_patterns.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>My notes from IDF course (30 pages!)</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ui.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/ui.png"/></a><a href="assets/images/ux/ui2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/ui2.png"/></a></p>
    <p>As a UI designer, your goal is to create a user interface that is engaging, beautiful, and also creates an emotional response from the user to make your products more lovable and beautiful.</p>
    <p>When I started out, something I learned from my mentor is to take a tour guide journey to your product. Imagine your app/website as a journey. Every user that downloads your app right from spotting it in the App Store/web, through using it, achieving goals or completing tasks within the app is taken on a journey. And that journey should be a delightful one.</p>
    <p><strong>Alignment</strong> is a fundamental aspect of UI Design. And an important design principle is: minimize the number of alignment lines. It improves readibility and makes the design more pleasing to the eye.<br>
        There are two fundamental types of alignment: Edge alignment and Center alignment.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>edge alignment: all the elements having one side or edge lining up with a single line</li>
        <li>center alignment: you line up all the elements by their midpoint</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Become an attention architect.</strong>Here’s two ways to interpret this: you need to </p>
    <ol>
        <li>grab the user’s attention with your design</li>
        <li>pay attention to every little thing in your designs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To be a great designer, you need to do both. The latter lets you achieve the former.</p>
    <p>UI Design is about tailoring the experience for your users by guiding their attention towards different important things.</p>
    <p class="lead">Ways to use text to grab user’s attention:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>make its size larger or smaller</li>
        <li>bolder or brighter in color. Or make it muted</li>
        <li>use a typeface with a heavy weighting versus something that is thin or light</li>
        <li>italicize words. Capitalise or lowercase some words</li>
        <li>increase the distance between each of the letters to make the overall size of the words take up more space</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most important thing when designing is testing! Make sure you try out different everything: colors, fonts, tones, angles, alignment, layout, etc. Experiment with different designs so that you can architect a user journey using various ways of commanding attention.</p>

    <p class="lead">From The non-Designer Design Book:</p>
    <p>4 basic principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: avoid elements on the page that are merely similar. If the elements (type colour, size, line thickness, shape, space etc) are not the same, then make them very different. Contrast is often the most important visual attraction on a page. It clarifies the communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: you can repeat colours, shapes, textures, spatial relationships, line thickness, fonts, sizes, graphic concepts etc. This develops the organisation and strengthnes the unity. Consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page. This creates a clean and sophisticated look.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: items relating to each other should be grouped close together. When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. This helps organise information, reduces clutter and gives the reader a clear structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Voice User Interface design is a promising brand new field which provides solutions through voice control. With VUI and GUI combined, human-machine interaction can be enhanced and streamlined using input via facial expressions, gestures, and audio.</p>
    <p>Combining GUI and VUI presents challenges:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>coordinate voice and gesture input</li>
            <li>determine whether to speak or display</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Combining GUI and VUI has benefits:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>leverage advantages of both GUI and VUI</li>
            <li>user convenience</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Plan and develop carefully:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>user test, test, and test some more</li>
        </ul>
