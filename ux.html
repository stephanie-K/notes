    <h3>80/20 The Pareto principle</h3>
    <p>A Management Consultant Joseph M Juran back in the 1940s. He noticed that there is a general rule in business and in life – that 80% of the effects of a process come from just 20% of the inputs. He named this principle the “Pareto Principle” after the Italian Economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923).<br>
        The Pareto Principle is useful because it allows us to focus our efforts on the areas that bring the most rewards. It’s used in almost every business discipline. For example, sales people will note that 20% of their accounts bring 80% of their sales.
    </p>
    <p>It’s important to note that 80%/20% is not exact. <strong> What is almost always true is that a small proportion of the efforts (inputs) will generate a larger than expected level of results (outputs).</strong>
        It doesn’t matter how complex your website or application is, you will find that when you dig down into user analytics – the Pareto Principle will come into play. A small fraction of the functionality (or pages) will receive the majority of user time; this doesn’t mean that the rest of the functionality or content has no value but it does mean that some functionality and content is more important to the majority of your users than some of the rest.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The Pareto Principle or 80-20 Rule can be very effective in helping you make decisions in your user experience work. </strong>From research and analytics to higher level stuff like project management, wherever there is data that can be quantified there’s the possibility that you can use this rule to focus your efforts on the areas of your work that bring the most results.<br>
        However, you always need to be mindful of sample sizes and of other forms of data which may override the Pareto Principle in practice.

    <p>At its core, A/B testing is exactly what it sounds like: you have two versions of an element (A and B) and a metric that defines success. To determine which version is better, you subject both versions to experimentation simultaneously. In the end, you measure which version was more successful and select that version for real-world use.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, digital products must be able to exist across any and all devices, screen sizes, and mediums at the same time. So why the hell are we still designing our products by “page” or by screen?!<br>
        <strong>Instead, we should be creating beautiful and easy access to content, regardless of device, screen size or context.</strong></p>

    <p>If you want to design a website for kids, or are developing an app for them, here are a few key points to remember:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>instant feedback after every action confirms their effect</li>
        <li>don’t expect patience from them</li>
        <li>don’t rely on copy if possible</li>
        <li>small kids take everything literally</li>
        <li>trust doesn’t only mean giving consistent feedback but also that their parents can rely on our product for their kids’ safety</li>
        <li>use age groups, challenge them age-appropriately</li>
        <li>design for kids is still paid for by parents — always take them into consideration, too</li>

    <h3>Design Language System</h3>
    <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/design-language-system-d438f4aa30e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Medium : Design Language System</strong></a></p>
    <p> A Design Language System is a set of rules or guidelines that heightens the level of harmony in a digital ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Now what is a digital ecosystem? It is nothing but interdependent group of enterprises, people or things that share a standardized digital platform for mutually beneficial purposes. To keep this ecosystem in harmony we need to understand the different groups involved, their requirements and expectations to build a wholesome design system that is scalable and efficient at the same time. This interdependent group of enterprises/people/things is where all of you (designers, developers) come in. All you should be doing is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get everyone ready and on the same page</li>
            <li>Collaborate at healthy intervals to curate a wholesome design language system</li>
            <li>Keep in mind the collective desire to provide good user experience while adding to internal efficiency</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The Design Language System is like setting a foundation for you to build on. It’ll make the build time shorter and much more efficient. </p>

    <p>Helping people make better decisions sometimes means designing complex interactions.<br>
        The world seems to think that the only outcome the customer is interested in is speed, but there are other outcomes we should be designing for: confidence; a sense of control; the suitability of a product or service that users need. Designers need to recognise that the flow needs moments of reflection and focus. Making the user stop and consider their decisions may add time, but — done well — it needn’t detract from a smooth sense of flow in an experience. Essential information points should not be so easily glossed over or missed, but highlighted and featured as important points of reference.
        </p>
    <p>There is a necessary complexity to many interactions, putting these processes online and on a phone changes the dynamic, but it doesn’t reduce the complexity, or the risk. They are complex by their very nature, requiring thought and consideration.</p>

    <p>Ways to influence the product owners</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>number 1 rule: respect</strong> - The thing with humans is, quite often, we think other people know what we know. Or everyone remembers the way we remember. It’s simply not the case. Sometimes, people genuinely come to daft conclusions because they don’t know something or they remember a meeting in an entirely different way to us. That’s because they have different baggage they bring with them. By remembering this, you start to get an idea that someone isn’t ‘blocking’ you; they are just in a different space with different information. To get your idea across really well, you need to bridge that gap between what you think you both know and what you actually know.</li>
        <li><strong>show, don't tell</strong> - When you are talking to someone about a new idea, have something to show. It can be bits of paper with line drawings on, little prototypes, someone else’s data that supports your idea – anything. When talking in the abstract, you are allowing people to fill in gaps in their head – they may not tell you what they are thinking but still say no. Have something tangible to look at, point at, and work out.</li>
        <li><strong>get out of the room</strong> - Use data and show that it's not your opinion but Research, studies showing something is not right. It's harder to fight research than fight your opinion or advice</li>
        <li><strong>use the silence</strong> - Often, if you are quiet, people just keep talking to fill the void. When they do that, they can, quite literally, talk themselves around. Don’t feel the need to speak in natural pauses. Let them do it. Sometimes, if you are bringing a new idea out of the blue, people need to think about it. Some people do that while talking. What I am saying is, give them a chance and stay  quiet. This is also the time when they tell you about all the stuff they thought you knew, or thought you didn’t need to know</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOV.UK - Structuring forms</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/designing-more-efficient-forms-structure-inputs-labels-and-actions-e3a47007114f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Designing More Efficient Forms: Structure, Inputs, Labels and Actions</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-ux-behind-designing-better-forms-d6ebe7a817d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>On UX Design</strong></a></p>
    <p><strong>Align the sections:</strong> Alignment is nothing but arranging text in the most efficient way- allowing for efficient, effective scanning and limiting errors or missed fields. Basically, having the label text as close to the input field makes the grouping more relatable. It is easier to associate them due to their proximity.</p>
    <p><strong>Group related fields:</strong> Grouping information into chunks is an easy way to highlight association. If the form has more than six fields, it is recommended to group them into logical sections. These steps are even more emphasised if each section is given their respective header, and are neatly arranged in a top-down order.</p>
    <p><strong>Write clear labels:</strong> Using succinct and crisp labels. It helps the user understand what information is required in one glance. Avoid using complete sentences to explain simple questions, just one or two words generally suffice.</p>
    <p><strong>Input field format:</strong> design the input fields in a customised manner, which explicitly shows how the information is to be fed in.</p>
    <p><strong>Adding visual cues:</strong> Giving a few suggestions upfront is a good way to get their thoughts running. And representing these options with additional visual cues can turn out to be even better, as it requires minimal cognitive load and provides a direction of thought.</p>
    <p><strong>Optional vs compulsory:</strong> This is a very simple trick to de-clutter a form page. Rather than mentioning ‘compulsory’ next to every header, just put an asterisk and mention the optional ones in words.</p>
    <p><strong>CTA call to action:</strong> CTAs can either look like a solid rectangular button, or a text link. Depending on your use case, make sure that only ONE of them is the prominent one. Mention what’s going to happen once you hit on the button. This clarity is essential for great CTAs.</p>
    <p><strong>Use colours efficiently:</strong> Colours can be cleverly used to direct the user’s attention, and add an aesthetic appeal to the design. The trick is to <strong>stick to not more than 2 main colours in the page</strong>. Just make sure to use them wisely, keeping the main goal of the form in mind.</p>
    <p><strong>Validate the form:</strong> 3 important messages that a good form validation should convey to the user:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>an error has occurred. Display clearly that there is an error in the form, preferably using a red color signal to attract attention</li>
        <li>where the error occurred: Highlighting the fields that caused the error</li>
        <li>how the error can be repaired: Provide information on what needs to be different in order for the field to validate</li>

    <p>A sitemap footer has the ability to minimize the efforts users need to take in navigating through a website. When you design clear and distinct links and place them in the footer at the bottom of the page, you allow users to explore other sections or navigate directly to relevant information, without having to return to the top of the page and navigate through the entire hierarchy. When implemented successfully, footers can take some of the pressure off the global navigation bar at the top of the page, resulting in a less cluttered and more appealing interface. Better still, if you use them consistently, they will serve as reassuring beacons for where to go next, thus lubricating the user’s journey to make it more seamless while helping optimize the whole experience.</p>

    <h3>Gamification</h3>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/notes_gamification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My notes from the IDF course (19 pages)</a></p>
    <p><strong>Gamification is the art of adding game-like elements to experiences which traditionally do not involve fun or games.</strong> As it’s a young industry, it should be easier to get a “foot in the door” of gamification companies with demand for experienced designers far outstripping supply, and that means those businesses are going to be keen to take a chance on less-experienced but well-qualified designers.</p>
    <p>A review of the literature to date has shown a positive correlation that<strong> gamification does increase the effectiveness of the activity it is applied to</strong>. Of course, a lot depends on how gamification is used – a gamification can only work if the players find it motivating, interesting and fun. </p>
    <p><strong>The “Player-Centered Design” approach</strong> involves using the following five steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>know your player</li>
        <li>identify the mission</li>
        <li>understand human motivation</li>
        <li>apply mechanics</li>
        <li>manage, monitor and measure</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/player-centered-Design.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/player-centered-Design.png"/></a></p>
    <p><strong>The Four Basic Principles of Fun in a Game:</strong> Goals, Rules, Feedback, Voluntary Participation</p>

    <p class="lead">A SMART mission</p>
    <p>It enables you to communicate to the gamification team not just what needs to be addressed through the project but also how you will be able to demonstrate success at the end of the project. The SMART goal-setting system is a remarkably effective tool that can help you define and fine-tune the real solution. It lets you remove all the obstacles that would otherwise lead to your arriving at false solutions.<br>
        If you understand what the situation is and what situation is required, it should be easy to build a SMART mission which promotes the success of your gamification exercise.<br>
        Gamification projects aren’t just about players; we also use them to achieve business results. Your gamification design team must research exactly what the business expects and ensure that everyone involved in the project focusses on these expectations throughout the design process. The idea is to create engagement with players that achieves results and return on investment. Getting the balance between fun engagement and serious results will pay off time and again for you as you progress to later gamification works in your career.

    <p>Ways to make an experience feel game-like and ways to fit lessons from games into web and app experiences — when the context allows, of course:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Document everything</strong></li>
        <p>In games, documentation can be used as a guiding force. Game design documentation can be short (1 page) or long (past 30 pages), but it always helps creators define game elements up front. Translating this to digital product design, this can be a document that outlines personas, user goals, and other information such as key statistics to track. This can help people who need information about current and upcoming projects to get going as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>If you decide to prioritize documentation, remember to write it as you go. It is more tedious to do everything at the end than to spend 15 minutes sharing updates every few days. There are lots of programs and apps you can use; InVision, Google Drive, and Basecamp are just a few. They all make it incredibly convenient to be a better communicator.</p>
        <li><strong>Simple isn’t always best</strong></li>
        <p>Complexity is important in games because it provides challenges for players to overcome. Game makers excel at ensuring the addition of complex features include usefulness and meaning. If every part of a game is complicated, players will quit. However, the right amount of roadblocks can make players feel accomplished when they are surpassed.</p>
        <p>Many apps are challenging to master, but worth the reward. This effort makes users feel like pros. For example, I am a loyal Sketch user because I know the ins and outs of the product. Finding new features and shortcuts gives me a sense of accomplishment. Consider ways to do the same in your product, especially if user goals require it to support a complex set of actions.</p>
        <li><strong>Connect through emotions and personality</strong></li>
        <p>Journey mapping is the process of mapping out how a user in a specific scenario feels during each step of a specific set of tasks. Journey mapping an existing set of features can help designers understand where improvements can be made, and journey mapping while creating user flows for new projects enables designers to avoid potential pitfalls.<br>
        In addition to emotions, people love personality. They want to identify with those behind the products they use and the games they play. In games, this is usually expressed through hidden secrets called easter eggs. Game designers use them to connect with players while rewarding them with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
        <li><strong>Give feedback</strong></li>
        <p>Responsiveness is important in games. It gives players the sense that their actions are contributing to changes shown on screen. In games, this feedback is known as “game feel” or “juice”. It is often expressed as screen shaking and changes in scale and color of objects.</p>
        <li><strong>Be intentional</strong></li>
        <p>Game elements shine when they are intentionally included. Users can tell when an experience is game-like as a gimmick. If you are considering the addition of game elements into your experiences, carefully think about their purpose.</p>

        <li>what will I find when I get there?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Review your Information Architecture:</strong><br>
        Do a user research by using card sorting method. Let your users categorize your IA based on their intuition and their “information scents” to know more on what the users want and how they would like to use the apps. After you did a little research, then you can start building your new IA for your apps.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Start using tab bars:</strong><br>
        So far, the best solution for mobile apps seems to be a tab bar. Either you place it on the top or the bottom of the screen. (It’s up to you where you want to put it. But it would best to put it on top if you are designing for responsive web). When you have your new IA, you can prioritize to use 4–5 icon + text button for your primary navigation options. This is the approach that Facebook has settled for their mobile apps and their apps navigation structure. Here’s their mobile web, iOS apps, and Android apps screenshot for example:
    </p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/hamburger.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-three-quarters-width" src="assets/images/ux/hamburger.png"/></a></p>
    <p>The main benefit of using the icon + text structure is that it allows you to fit in all text while keeping the button size large enough to deal with the big thumbs.<br>
        If you must expand before 5 tabs, the common practice is to use the last tab bar to provide access to the remaining option, similar to the hamburger menu.<br>
        If your desktop apps have a more robust navigation menu, then take the most important elements of your websites and convert them into a tab bar. The other elements can still be available through “more” or “other” tabs. Product Hunt did something interesting with their navigation system. They use a text-based navigation on their mobile and called it “navigation” to replace the hamburger menu.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Other recommendations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>draw a clear line between modal-views and child-views and know when to use which</li>
        <li>only use modal-views for self-contained processes (and fullscreen detail-views in rare occasions)</li>
        <li>use child-views for everything else</li>
        <li>display the tab bar / bottom navigation on every view including child-views</li>
        <li>hide navigation bars (at the top of the screen) and tab bars (at the bottom of the screen) when scrolling down if you want to create focus and maximise screen estate (e.g. for articles, …)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>8 golden rules from Shneiderman +  Nielsen & Mochlich's heuristics = 10 rules of thumb </p>
    <ul>
        <li>visibility of sytem status</li>
        <li>match between system and the real world</li>
        <li>user control and freedom</li>
        <li>consistency and standards</li>
        <li>error prevention</li>
        <li>recognition rather than recall</li>
        <li>flexibility and effiency of use</li>
        <li>aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
        <li>help users recognise, diagnose and recover from error</li>
        <li>help and documentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These 10 rules of thumb should only generally be used to inform and inspire a designer’s and a company’s development of their own specific heuristics. In combination with market research, other design guidelines and requirements, using your company or product-specific heuristics will better suit the design under scrutiny</p>
    <p>How to Generate and Conduct Your Own Heuristic Evaluation</p>
    <ul>
        <li>establish an appropriate list of heuristics</li>
        <li>select your evaluators (they should not be your end users) they should have domain expertise</li>
        <li>brief your evaluators :  so they know exactly what they are meant to do and cover during their evaluation. The briefing session should be standardized to ensure the evaluators receive the same instructions; otherwise you may bias their evaluation. </li>
        <li>1st evaluation phase: it generally takes around two hours, depending on the nature and complexity of your product. The evaluators will use the product freely to gain a feel for the methods of interaction and the scope. They will then identify specific elements that they want to evaluate.</li>
        <li>2nd evaluation phase: the evaluators will carry out another run-through, whilst applying the chosen heuristics to the elements identified during the first phase. The evaluators would focus on individual elements and look at how well they fit in the overall design.</li>
        <li>record problems: The evaluators must record problems themselves or you should record them as they carry out their various tasks to track any problems they encounter.</li>
        <li>debriefing session: this involves collaboration between the different evaluators to collate their findings and establish a complete list of problems. They should then be encouraged to suggest potential solutions for these problems on the basis of the heuristics.</li>

    <h3>Hick's Law: Making the choice easier for users</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users?r=stephanie-krus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong></strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/hicks.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/hicks.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that <strong>the more stimuli (or choices) users face, the longer it will take them to make a decision.</strong> For designers of all types, this presents a challenge, making it imperative to offer the most useful set of options to avoid frustrating the user. This can be vital for safety. The U.S. Navy was quick to recognize the importance of the “Keep It Simple and Straightforward” (“K.I.S.S.”) principle, which reflects Hick’s Law.</p>
    <p>As web designers, we have an important choice to make before presenting users with the choices we hope they will select on our sites. We have to use Hick’s Law in conjunction with other design principles, especially on the landing page to make the most-desired option/s stand out.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, there’s no avoiding complexity, especially if we’re involved with presenting a huge amount of needed information about sophisticated products or intricate services. Using Hick’s Law can help us reduce that complexity by simplifying the decision-making process for our users.</p>
    <p>To make our designs work, we need to remember that a) the user’s time is precious, and b) a user is not obligated to stay on our site. To enhance the user experience, we should consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>categorizing Choice</strong> – Enabling users to find items from higher categories, as if they were looking under sections in a library.</li>
        <li><strong>obscuring Complexity</strong> – Breaking up long or complex processes into screens with fewer options.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once your website or app is live, you can use variables such as “time on site” and “page views” to understand if Hick’s law has been applied correctly.</p>
    <p>Overall, remember that Hick’s Law is a guideline you can adapt to your design. Always try to “flip” the perspective to see the choices you want to present from the outside. Avoid flooding with options, but bear in mind the balance between users’ time and comfort zones for handling options on a page. Guiding them to select between clear options that will get them somewhere quickly (such as a shopping cart) will take the work out of the user experience and reward you both.</p>
    <p>As a user experience designer, you have a great ally in the card-sorting method. Keep in mind that you 1) first need to find out who are your users and what they need, 2) then define the functionalities your product and service will offer to meet these needs, and 3) use methods such as card sorting to build the right categorization and labels for these categories.</p>

    <h3>IKEA effect</h3>
    <p>The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that can influence the outcome and perceived value of products to a big degree. People tend to place high value on products they partially have created.<br>
        The more the needs for customization and co-production are present in your target audience the more the IKEA effect is relevant for you as a designer. The effect can help you instil feelings of competence in the user when the task is completed successfully.<br>
        The IKEA effect will create stronger bond between the user and the product. The effort that users will put into completing the product to a complete state will transform into love for that product. The subjective value will be higher in comparison to a product that hasn’t cost any effort.
        </p>
    <p>It is important to point out that <strong>the IKEA effect is not about putting the effort be it small or big, it is more about the completion of the task.</strong> The IKEA effect is present when <strong>the user can enjoy the completed task and the product.</strong> If the product is disassembled soon after the assembling the effect is lost.</p>
    <p><strong>Sometimes saving the users a bit of labour could deprive them from a bit more happiness if they were to make the small effort.</strong> Think if you should decrease the user effort to zero or close to zero.</p>
    <p>To make use of the effect we should engage people in the design and increase their sense of product ownership and brand loyalty. This way our designs will be loved more.</p>

    <p>5 Steps to Designing an Information Visualization<br>
            The overall process is simple and once you’ve reviewed the process, it should feel like common sense:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>define the problem</li>
        <li>define the data to be represented</li>
        <li>define the dimensions required to represent the data</li>
        <li>define the structures of the data</li>
        <li>define the interaction required from the visualisation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This process of how to design an information visualization is not concerned with your final output but rather enabling you to make an informed decision on what forms of representation might best serve your users. By understanding a user’s needs, the data to be displayed and the relationships in that data as well as the kind of model required; the information visualization designer can deliver a model which meets those needs.</p>

    <h3>Interaction design</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-interaction-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>What is Interaction Design?</strong></a></p>
    <p>It is the design of the interaction between users and products. The goal of interaction design is to create products that enable the user to achieve their objective(s) in the best way possible.</p>
    <p><strong>UX design is more than interaction design:</strong> it also involves user research (finding out who the users are in the first place), creating user personas (why, and under what conditions, would they use the product), performing user testing and usability testing, etc.</p>
    <p>The 5 dimensions of interaction design is a useful model to understand what interaction design involves.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>words</strong> like button label, should be meaningful and simple to understand. They should communicate information to users, but not too much information to overwhelm the user.</li>
        <li><strong>visual representations</strong> graphical elements like images, typography and icons that users interact with. These usually supplement the words used to communicate information to users.</li>
        <li><strong>physical objects or space</strong> is the user standing in a crowded train while using the app on a smartphone, or sitting on a desk in the office surfing the website? These all affect the interaction between the user and the product.</li>
        <li><strong>time</strong> refers to media that changes with time (animation, videos, sounds). Motion and sounds play a crucial role in giving visual and audio feedback to users’ interactions. Also of concern is the amount of time a user spends interacting with the product: can users track their progress, or resume their interaction some time later?</li>
        <li><strong>behaviour</strong> how do users perform actions on the website? How do users operate the product? In other words, it’s how the previous dimensions define the interactions of a product. It also includes the reactions—for instance emotional responses or feedback—of users and the product.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/5D.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/5D.gif"/></a></p>
    <p>Important questions interaction designers ask:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>what can a user do with their mouse, finger, or stylus to directly interact with the interface? </li>
        <li>what about the appearance (colour, shape, size, etc.) gives the user a clue about how it may function?</li>
        <li>do error messages provide a way for the user to correct the problem or explain why the error occurred?</li>
        <li>what feedback does a user get once an action is performed?</li>
        <li>are the interface elements a reasonable size to interact with?</li>
        <li>are familiar or standard formats used? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>What do interaction designers do? <br>
    Design strategy which can include doing your own UR>, wireframes that lay out the interactions of the product. In some cases, interactive prototypes are created.</p>

    <p><strong>Lean UX - What is it?</strong><br>
    Lean UX is focused on the experience under design and is less focused on deliverables than traditional UX. It requires a greater level of collaboration with the entire team. The core objective is to focus on obtaining feedback as early as possible so that it can be used to make quick decisions. The nature of Agile development is to work in rapid, iterative cycles and Lean UX mimics these cycles to ensure that data generated can be used in each iteration.</p>

    <p>Moments of truth are based on interactions with your product or brand that either make or break the user or customer experience.

            <li>an NUI should have a clear learning path and allow both novice and expert users to interact in a natural way</li>
            <li>interaction with an NUI should be direct and fit the user’s context</li>
            <li>whenever possible, you should prioritize taking advantage of the user’s basic skills</li>

    <p>Remember, the proof of your NUI’s success will be a matter that users will decide for you in a very short time on accessing your design. So, keep their identity, needs and context in mind every step of the way. Just as importantly, stay mindful of how ‘clever’ an aspect of your NUI actually is—great design is about satisfying needs, not outsmarting users.</p>

    <h3>OKR = Objectives and Key Results</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01BFKJA0Y/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_VEbTAb8ZPKWR1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>On Amazon</strong></a></p>
    <p>It's a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.</p>
    <p>The OKR framework was created by Intel CEO Andy Grove and brought to Google by venture capitalist John Doerr and has been used by several companies including Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Uber.</p>
    <p>The OKR framework aims to define company and team "objectives" along with linked and measurable "key results" to provide "a critical thinking framework and ongoing discipline that seeks to ensure employees work together, focusing their efforts to make measurable contributions." OKRs are typically set at the company, team and personal levels and may be shared across the organization with the intention of providing teams with visibility of goals with the intention to align and focus effort.</p>

    <h3>Procurement</h3>
    <p>This is the process of finding, agreeing terms and acquiring goods, services or works from an external source, often via a tendering or competitive bidding process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services or works at the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared. Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimising risk, such as exposure to fraud and collusion.</p>

     <p>They hide the choices they represent. Users have to interact with the control before they know what they're being asked, which makes it harder to comprehend things at a glance.<br> 
        They're hard for some people to use. Less experienced users can struggle to use these controls, especially if they contain a lot of options - either they don't know how to interact with them, or they're unaware that they can scroll through the list.<br> 
        They can cause accessibility issues. On some devices the list of options cannot be zoomed, which means that some people with visual impairments cannot use them.

    <p><strong>What is Rapid Prototyping?</strong><br>
        It is not just wireframes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wireframes are the skeletal structure of user interfaces. It shows the structure, layout, content and functionality of a page.</li>
            <li>Rapid Prototyping is part of the design process after you have a clear grasp of the problem and your users’ needs. At this stage, the designer thinks about what needs to be done to reach the end goal and goes through a series of quick iterations and feedback sessions that could potentially solve the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What you see at the end of a rapid prototyping session are wireframes that you can use to demonstrate the idea but within these ‘wireframes’ are solutions.</p>
        <p>Sketches and rapid prototyping shows others how you think through problems. Your solutions should come to you through sketching, feedback and multiple design iterations.</p>

    <p class="lead"><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/9-principles-of-service-design-3486a097b10e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>9 Principles of Service Design</strong></a></p>
    <p>According to Nielsen Norman, service design is: The activity of planning and organizing a business’s resources (people, props, and processes) in order to (1) directly improve the employee’s experience, and (2) indirectly, the customer’s experience.</p>
    <p>An interface is not a service. A product is not a service. A service is not a physical object and cannot be possessed.</p>
    <p>9 basic categories or ways in which organizations can improve service design.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NOT placing the business needs before the user’s needs</li>
        <li>NOT making it hard to achieve the goal</li>
        <li>personalising the service</li>
        <li>before you even knew you needed it</li>
        <li>the follow-up</li>
        <li>mitigating the wait</li>
        <li>Peak-end Rule (in memory, we remember the peak and ending of an experience in greater detail)</li>
        <li>the runaround (being passed from one person/thing to the next)</li>
        <li>duplicate efforts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, the user experience is an entire ecosystem extending far beyond the boundaries of an interface or product. Service is part of that ecosystem. And to adequately address service design, we must map the experience to identify systemic failures along with organizational policies resulting in a poor experience for the user.</p>
    <p class="lead"><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/service-design-and-ux-design-whats-the-difference-508c41c65217" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Service Design and UX Design - what's the difference</strong></a></p>
    <p>Service designers aim to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>understand thoroughly the service proposition of the organisation or company in question</li>
        <li>discern the needs of all the stakeholders and actors in a service — both customers and service providers</li>
        <li>map out the service through a service ecology, service blueprint, and user journeys</li>
        <li>co-create possible solutions or improvements by collaborating with service stakeholders</li>
        <li>prototype and pilot new service experiences with real customers and staff</li>
        <li>zoom in and out constantly between the details of individual touchpoints and the design of the overall service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Service design starts by looking to make improvement in people, processes, assets and culture. That then indirectly goes on to influence the customer experience.</p>

    <p>A good service should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>let a user do waht they set out to do</li>
        <li>be easy to find</li>
        <li>clearly explain it's purpose</li>
        <li>set the expectations a user has of it</li>
        <li>be agnostic of organisational structures</li>
        <li>require as few steps as possible to complete a task</li>
        <li>be consistent</li>
        <li>have no dead ends</li>
        <li>be usable by everyone, equally</li>
        <li>respond to change quickly</li>
        <li>work in a way that is familiar</li>
        <li>encourage the right behaviour in users (and designers)</li>
        <li>clearly explain why a decision has been made</li>

    <h3>Usability testing</h3>
    <p>This is largely a qualitative activity. We usually have a small sample of users.</p>
    <p><strong>Quantitative</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>time on task</li>
        <li>success/failure rates  <strong>(number one metric captured in UT)</strong> = ease of use</li>
        <li>do they get the task (success rate) do they not (failure rate), do they get part of it (partial success)</li>
        <li>effort: e.g. number of clicks / perception of progress</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Qualitative</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>stress responses (looking at their face, change in body language)</li>
        <li>subjective satisfaction (a questionnaire about how well they think they did)</li>
        <li>perceived effort or difficulty</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4 steps</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>create test plan: </strong>recruit the users, define the test scope, identify objectives, establish metrics</li>
        <li><strong>facilitate test: </strong>observe users, identify issues, identify solutions, interview users</li>
        <li><strong>analyse test data: </strong>assess user behaviour, analyse user click path. identify problem areas, assess navigation</li>
        <li><strong>create test report</strong>review video footage, identify design issues, identify best practices, design recommendations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why metrics: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>very important to have data to convince the rest of the team of stakeholder</li>
        <li>make usability recommendations concrete</li>
        <li>ground teams in reality</li>
        <li>help iterate and validate design concepts</li>
        <li>provide objectivity to design debates</li>
        <li>guide fact-based design decision</li>
    </ul>
    <p>usability issues</p>
    <ul>
        <li>not seeing something</li>
        <li>going in the wrong direction</li>
        <li>thinking ti's correct when it's not</li>
        <li>missing a rule</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Usability Testing and Moderating Skills Why do we test by scenario?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>more realism with real world behaviour</li>
        <li>to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for the test participant</li>
        <li>so we don't give away what we are testing</li>
        <li>so <strong>we don't lead the witness</strong>, we need to be a bit obscure and not use the vocabulary of the product</li>
        <li>scenario simulate real-life the closest</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conduct a pilot test:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>always conduct a live fire test the day before to iron out any issues</li>
        <li>for mobile testing: always test reception in the room or the area you will be testing in </li>
        <li>make sure lightning is ok for the screen of the device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why think aloud? </strong>Asking users to think aloud helps you track their thought patterns. This becomes the running commentary on task performance (which you observe and take notes on). Remind them that we are testing the interface, not them. </p>
    <p>We are observers, we do not talk. Even if the user is asking us something, if we do not respond they will usually move on. We can say ok, or uh huh, but not good or bad. Need to stay neutral. You can use reverse questions (is this what you were expecting?).</p>

    <p>Gathering feedback is a crucial element in the Design Thinking process – and in all other human-centred design processes. In order to maximise the benefits of gathering feedback, however, you need to be purposeful about it. Here are some pointers to take note of when thinking about gathering feedback from your users.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ways to solicit feedback</li>
        <li>test your prototypes on the right people</li>
        <li>ask the right questions</li>
        <li>be neutral when presenting your ideas</li>
        <li>adapt while testing</li>
        <li>let the user contribute ideas</li>

    <h3>User Centered Design</h3>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ucd.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/ucd.png"/></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/user-centered-design-process-and-benefits-fd9e431eb5a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>User-Centered Design: Process and Benefits</strong></a></p>
    <p>User-centered design creates a unique chance to design together with communities. User-centered designers deeply understand the folks they’re trying to serve. They create lots of ideas and make innovative new products rooted in people’s actual needs.</p>
    <p>To design in a user-centric way identify the people who will use the product, what they’ll use it for, and the conditions under which they will use it. Observe people’s lives, hear their hopes and needs, and get smart about your challenge.</p>
    <p><strong>User-centered design process goes through six phases:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>specify the use context and users’ needs</li>
        <li>specify business requirements</li>
        <li>build design solutions from rough concept to finished design</li>
        <li>evaluate designs with usability testing</li>
        <li>implementation — develop and deliver the product</li>
        <li>deployment — the final product is evaluated, as consumer needs change</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Responsive principles of user-centered design:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>clear understanding of the users, tasks and environments</li>
        <li>evaluation-driven design</li>
        <li>considering the general consumer experience</li>
        <li>involving the client within the design process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>User-centered designers test, fail and try once more. This method combines analysis, interviews, generative strategies, and tools like group action. UCD, for the most part, develops an understanding of the user’s desires through the inclusion of users at all stages of the designing and testing. We rely on feedback from everybody in the group. Iteration keeps design process responsive.</p>
    <p>In user-centered design, you have to be comfortable with the idea of failure and celebrate the learning which it brings. You try something out, maybe pushing too far, or you want to learn from an experiment. And your half-baked idea didn’t quite work out how you expected. But in some ways, <strong>the learning that came from that unexpected failure was more valuable than the success might have been.</strong></p>
    <p>When it comes to implementation, that’s when you don’t want quite as much failure to happen. Because <dtrong>the process starts getting more expensive</dtrong>. You’ll be putting all your effort into making something. But even then you need to be constantly experimenting and refining. So <strong>with user-centered design even in case of failure you continue to prototype and improve your UX. With user-centered desig</strong>n, you will not have avoidable rework or even worse a big failure right at the end. Because UCD identifies problems before they emerge.</p>

    <h3>UI</h3>
    <p>Simply put, UI is how things look, UX is how things work. UX is a process, while UI is a deliverable.</p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/notes/notes_UI_patterns.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>My notes from IDF course (30 pages!)</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ui.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/ui.png"/></a></p>
    <p>As a UI designer, your goal is to create a user interface that is engaging, beautiful, and also creates an emotional response from the user to make your products more lovable and beautiful.</p>
    <p>When I started out, something I learned from my mentor is to take a tour guide journey to your product. Imagine your app/website as a journey. Every user that downloads your app right from spotting it in the App Store/web, through using it, achieving goals or completing tasks within the app is taken on a journey. And that journey should be a delightful one.</p>
    <p><strong>Alignment</strong> is a fundamental aspect of UI Design. And an important design principle is: minimize the number of alignment lines. It improves readibility and makes the design more pleasing to the eye.<br>
        There are two fundamental types of alignment: Edge alignment and Center alignment.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>edge alignment: all the elements having one side or edge lining up with a single line</li>
        <li>center alignment: you line up all the elements by their midpoint</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Become an attention architect.</strong>Here’s two ways to interpret this: you need to </p>
    <ol>
        <li>grab the user’s attention with your design</li>
        <li>pay attention to every little thing in your designs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To be a great designer, you need to do both. The latter lets you achieve the former.</p>
    <p>UI Design is about tailoring the experience for your users by guiding their attention towards different important things.</p>
    <p class="lead">Ways to use text to grab user’s attention:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>make its size larger or smaller</li>
        <li>bolder or brighter in color. Or make it muted</li>
        <li>use a typeface with a heavy weighting versus something that is thin or light</li>
        <li>italicize words. Capitalise or lowercase some words</li>
        <li>increase the distance between each of the letters to make the overall size of the words take up more space</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most important thing when designing is testing! Make sure you try out different everything: colors, fonts, tones, angles, alignment, layout, etc. Experiment with different designs so that you can architect a user journey using various ways of commanding attention.</p>

    <p><strong>Call-to-action buttons</strong> are one of the most powerful sales tools in e-commerce and an influential factor of good conversion of a page or screen.

    <p>Voice User Interface design is a promising brand new field which provides solutions through voice control. With VUI and GUI combined, human-machine interaction can be enhanced and streamlined using input via facial expressions, gestures, and audio.</p>
    <p>Combining GUI and VUI presents challenges:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>coordinate voice and gesture input</li>
            <li>determine whether to speak or display</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Combining GUI and VUI has benefits:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>leverage advantages of both GUI and VUI</li>
            <li>user convenience</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Plan and develop carefully:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>user test, test, and test some more</li>

    <h3>Wireframe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>blueprint for a site or app layout</li>
        <li>show important functionality</li>
        <li>conveys content type and grouping </li>
        <li>show information hierarchy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They quickly generate ideas, aids discussion, show content hierarchy and establish key functionality.<br>
        They can be static, code-based, for layout, information architecture or wireflow. <br>
        Static: They are quick to create, there is a variety of tools and software but wireframe are not responsive.<br>
        code-based one are: responsive, interactive, in the browser but they can take longer to do, require coding knowledge, and might be difficult to interprete.
        </p>
    <p>For example below with Adobe Illustrator: show real content (Static)</p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe1.png"/></a></p>
    <p><strong>wireflow (= hydrid of flow chart + wireframe)</strong></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe2.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Balsamic, Omnigraffle, InVision, Sktech, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop Adobe XD (static wireframe)<br>
            Axure, Pattern Lab, GTML and CSS (code based wireframe)<br>
            High fidelity can be harder to understand for less technical people or can be confused with the real thing.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Annotations: </strong><br>
        Add labels to important features<br>
        Explain Key functionality<br>
        what happens in different states<br>
        Anything that isn't self explanatory
        </p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe3.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Wireframe appear very early in the design process.<br>
        Consideration to have: content needs, purpose, audience, fidelity, tools, annotation and documentation.<br>
        Wireframe planning: define the main purpose, what type of information is needed, what functionality is necessary and assign priority<br>        
        You can purchases components to make quicks wireframes: uxkits.com<br>
        To start, you ideally need: some discovery brief, competitive analysis, UR reports, Analytics, Site maps, Technical requirements, SEO recommendations, User personas
