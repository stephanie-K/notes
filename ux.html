        <h3>5 Whys</h3>
        <p>Quite literally, asking your users “Why?” whenever they explain their behaviours to you. Each time you ask “Why?”, you will prompt someone to re-evaluate their position in order to dig a little deeper into their own reasoning. It may seem a little odd to keep asking “Why?” at first, but it will bring great insights while allowing you to dig deeper in order to find the root cause(s) of their behaviours.</p>

        <h3>80/20 The Pareto principle</h3>
        <p>A Management Consultant Joseph M Juran back in the 1940s. He noticed that there is a general rule in business and in life – that 80% of the effects of a process come from just 20% of the inputs. He named this principle the “Pareto Principle” after the Italian Economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923).<br>
            The Pareto Principle is useful because it allows us to focus our efforts on the areas that bring the most rewards. It’s used in almost every business discipline. For example, sales people will note that 20% of their accounts bring 80% of their sales.
        </p>
        <p>It’s important to note that 80%/20% is not exact. <strong> What is almost always true is that a small proportion of the efforts (inputs) will generate a larger than expected level of results (outputs).</strong>
            It doesn’t matter how complex your website or application is, you will find that when you dig down into user analytics – the Pareto Principle will come into play. A small fraction of the functionality (or pages) will receive the majority of user time; this doesn’t mean that the rest of the functionality or content has no value but it does mean that some functionality and content is more important to the majority of your users than some of the rest.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The Pareto Principle or 80-20 Rule can be very effective in helping you make decisions in your user experience work. </strong>From research and analytics to higher level stuff like project management, wherever there is data that can be quantified there’s the possibility that you can use this rule to focus your efforts on the areas of your work that bring the most results.<br>
            However, you always need to be mindful of sample sizes and of other forms of data which may override the Pareto Principle in practice.

        <p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/the-ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Ultimate Guide To A/B Testing</strong></a></p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ab.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/ab.gif"/></a></p>
        <p>At its core, A/B testing is exactly what it sounds like: you have two versions of an element (A and B) and a metric that defines success. To determine which version is better, you subject both versions to experimentation simultaneously. In the end, you measure which version was more successful and select that version for real-world use.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility and Inclusive Design</h3>

        <p><a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2018/04/vital-accessibility-design-principles.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Vital accessibility design principles</strong></a></p>
        <p><a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/seven-best-practices-for-inclusive-product-design-9476c61f1e17" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>7 best practices for inclusive product design</strong></a></p>
        <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/inclusive-design-mindset-6074e457728" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Inclusive Design Thinking mindset</strong></a></p>
        <p>Inclusive design is a methodology that is about valuing a diversity of experiences and abilities in the development of a product as well as in its future use. Designers should recognize that when accessibility issues are an add-on after the product has been developed, it is actually too late.</p>
        <p>Reframing the definition of disability from a health condition or personal attribute to, “a mismatch between the needs of an individual and a product, service, social structure, culture, or environment is huge because we all experience these mismatches on a day-to-day level whether they’re permanent, temporary or situational.</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/one-arm.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/one-arm.png"/></a></p>
        <p><strong>Inclusive design methods are a great addition to human-centered design methodologies. </strong></p>
        <p>Learning how people adapt to the world around them means spending time understanding their experience from their perspective.<br>
        When done well, we can recognise more than just the barriers that people encounter. We also recognise the motivations that all people have in common.</p>
        <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Designing for accessibility is not that hard</strong></a></p>
        <p>Digital accessibility refers to the practice of building digital content and applications that can be used by a wide range of people, including individuals who have visual, motor, auditory, speech, or cognitive disabilities.</p>
        <p>There is a strong business case for accessibility: studies show that accessible websites have better search results, they reach a bigger audience, they’re SEO friendly, have faster download times, they encourage good coding practices, and they always have better usability.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>add enough colour contrast: </strong>According to the W3C, the contrast ratio between text and its background should be at least 4.5 to 1 (conformance level AA.) The ratios become more forgiving with larger and heavier fonts since they’re easier to read at lower contrast. If your type is at least 18 pt or 14 pt bold, the minimum contrast ratio drops to 3 to 1</li>
            <li><strong>don’t use color alone to make critical information understandable: </strong>Try to use an indicator other than color such as text labels or patterns. When showing errors on the screen, don’t rely on colored text alone, add an icon or include a title to the message. Consider adding a visual cue such as font weight or underline text style to linked text in a paragraph, so the links stand out.</li>
            <li><strong>have clear focus indicators : </strong>People with visual and motoric disabilities should be able to navigate without a mouse or trackpad. Created focus indicators that are straight forward and obvious for all so that regardless of your level of ability, you can use a website or apps with clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>use labels or instructions with form fields and inputs: </strong>Always help people understand what they should do and write in a form. It’s best if labels don’t go away, even when the person is filling an input; people should never lose context with what they’re writing. People who use screen readers usually navigate through a form using the Tab key to jump through the form controls. The &lt;label&gt; elements are read for each form control. Any non-label text, as placeholder text, is usually skipped over.</li>
            <li><strong>write useful alternative text for your images and other non-text content: </strong>Try to describe what’s happening in the image, and how it matters to the story, rather than just saying something like “picture,” context is everything.<br>
                If the image is purely decorative or if it creates redundancy because the surrounding context already explains the content. Then adding an empty <alt> attribute will make screen readers skip it. If you don’t write any alt text, some screen readers will read the file name to the individual.</li>
            <li><strong>use correct markup on your content: </strong>Headings mark where the content starts — they’re tags given to text to define its style and purpose. Headings also establish the hierarchy of the content of the page.<br>
                Titles with big font sizes help a reader understand the order of the content better. Likewise, screen readers also use heading tags to read content. This way, people with low-vision get an overview of the page by reading each heading in a hierarchal flow.<br>
                It’s important to use proper structural elements when you develop a site. HTML elements communicate to the browser what kind of content they contain and how the browser should render or treat that content. The components and structure of a page are what arranges an accessibility tree. This tree is what powers screen readers which are used by people who are blind so they can “listen” to a page.</li>
            <li><strong>use strong typographic hierarchy: </strong>good typography is the key to good design. Ensure that typographic hierarchy makes sense without the use of too many different of shades of grays. Rely on strong type sizing and bolding to create a meaningful hierarchy so that information makes sense at a glance. Enabled support for dynamic font sizes. This way you can use the default accessibility feature to change the size of the text to what suits you best.</li>
           <li><strong>support keyboard navigation: </strong>Keyboard accessibility is one of the most critical aspects of web accessibility. People with motor disabilities, blind people that rely on screen readers, people that don’t have precise muscle control, and even power users are dependent on a keyboard to navigate content.<br>
            The focus state that we discussed before provides a visual indicator of the component that is currently selected.<br>
            As you navigate through a page, the order of the interactive elements is essential, and the navigation must be logical and intuitive. The tab order should follow the visual flow of the page: left to right, top to bottom — header, main navigation, content buttons and inputs, and finally the footer.<br>
            Be careful with the size of your navigation — this includes the number of links and the length of the text. Tabbing through long menus may be demanding for people with motor disabilities. And listening to lengthy links can be cumbersome for people that use screen readers—try to be concise. Providing ARIA landmarks or HTML5 structural elements like &lt;main&gt; or &lt;nav&gt; will make navigation easier. </li>
            <li><strong>use SVGs: </strong>Replace PNGs with SVGs so that icons and UI components render clear and sharp when you use the built-in zooming feature that’s available on most operating systems and browsers. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These guidelines will help you make your web design get closer to meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. There are 3 levels A is the lowest, AAA is the higest. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More info about level of conformance here.</p>

        <p>In UX, the method is used to organise research findings or to sort design ideas in ideation workshops, it should be quick and collaborative.</p>
        <p>2 steps</p>
        <ul>
            <li>generating sticky notes (during ideations workshop or usability testing session)</li>
            <li>organising them in groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We need to keep moving, it can be long, needs to be facilitated, encourage participant, set priorities.<br>
            Need a big wall, all notes on it no specific order<br>
            Create categories names, either before or if they emerge
        </p>
        <p>The general steps we’ll follow are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sort into top-level categories</li>
            <li>sort each of those categories into subcategories</li>

            Yell the new category name<br>
            If note is not clear, put in the ? category<br>
            If similar notes, stack them, most descriptive on top.
        </p>
        <p>Then divide categories in subcategories, on or two person per category<br>
            Present the category you sorted<br>
            Find the priorities (either use a scale, or people put points on them, each get 3)<br>
            Or 100$. value different ideas, total of price of ideas will be $100 <br>
            Or NUF: New Useful and Feasible: 1 to 7 for each attribute, then total and the idea with higher total has the priority. (newer is better)

        <p>UX workshops have <strong>numerous benefits</strong>: educate people and make them empathic towards users, make stakeholders feel involved and responsible for ideas and research findings, create awareness of usability issues and design challenges, build common ground across all parties involved, and bring together many types of backgrounds and expertise.</p>
        <p>However, in such UX workshops, it <strong>can be challenging</strong> to engaging the team, and creating order among diverse ideas and facts.</p>
        <p>I used to think that, as a user researcher, my job was to make the information I collected about users as understandable and digestible as possible for my team. And as a designer, I was supposed to come up with the best design solution. While I still feel these things are true, I have learned that <strong>insulating stakeholders from all the false starts, design ideas, details and messy notes taken in tests does them a disservice</strong>. To educate other team members, involve them in design, <strong>build consensus, and increase sensitivity to usability issues</strong>, get them involved in taking notes, sorting them, and discussing them rather that protecting them from these processes.</p>

            <li>instant feedback after every action confirms their effect</li>
            <li>don’t expect patience from them</li>

        <p>UX writing is the practice of crafting UI copy that guides users within a product and helps them interact with it. UI copy includes buttons and menu labels, error messages, security notes, terms and conditions, as well as any instructions on product usage.<br>
            The primary aim of UX writing is to settle communication between users and a digital product.</p>
        <p><strong>Work on text early because text problems often reveal design problems.</strong><br>
            If a team has trouble explaining a design, quite often it is the design, not the text copy, that needs improving.</p>
        <p>Tips On Writing UI Text</p>
        <ul>
            <li>be concise</li>
            <li>avoid long blocks of text</li>
            <li>avoid double negatives</li>
            <li>begin with the objective</li>
            <li>use specific verbs whenever possible</li>
            <li>make the copy consistent</li>
            <li>avoid jargon</li>
            <li>write in present tense</li>
            <li>write in the active voice</li>
            <li>Use numerals (number instead of their text version)</li>
            <li>avoid showing all details up front (progressive disclosure is especially good for mobile UI)</li>
            <li>identify interactive elements appropriately</li>
            <li>be careful when using humor</li>
            <li>use language that’s consistent with the user’s platform</li>
            <li>use ‘today,’ ‘yesterday’ or ‘tomorrow’ instead of a date</li>
            <li>use graphics if they will help you communicate</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead"></strong> Goals in your research:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>Helping people make better decisions sometimes means designing complex interactions.<br>
            The world seems to think that the only outcome the customer is interested in is speed, but there are other outcomes we should be designing for: confidence; a sense of control; the suitability of a product or service that users need. Designers need to recognise that the flow needs moments of reflection and focus. Making the user stop and consider their decisions may add time, but — done well — it needn’t detract from a smooth sense of flow in an experience. Essential information points should not be so easily glossed over or missed, but highlighted and featured as important points of reference.
            </p>
        <p>There is a necessary complexity to many interactions, putting these processes online and on a phone changes the dynamic, but it doesn’t reduce the complexity, or the risk. They are complex by their very nature, requiring thought and consideration.</p>

        <p>Ethnographic research, such as user observation and interviews, will allow you to discover who your users really are, and the environments in which they live. It will provide great insights into the way that your users will interact with your product.<br>
            There are specific challenges associated with ethnographic research—the main one being that it’s not a quantitative process. You don’t end up with neat numbers, graphs, and figures. Instead, it’s a qualitative process, which involves producing a great deal of unruly data that is hard to summarize. It is also difficult, and some would say impossible, not to let your own biases or assumptions sneak into the research process.<br>
            It’s important to focus on and empathise with the people you design for, and truly listen to and understand them, rather than concentrating on your expected process outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>You need to be aware of potential sources of bias and take care to eliminate them. You will also need as <strong>diverse a team</strong> as possible in order to obtain the best insights.</p>
        <p>Take time to <strong>introduce yourself, explain what’s going to happen, and invite questions from the start</strong>. Try to illustrate through the process that what the person is saying/doing is important and of value to you.</p>
        <p>Rather than guessing or assuming the reasons behind people’s behaviour—you should <strong>ask the people to explain things for themselves.</strong> You should listen to the answer, figure out what is not being said, and observe their body language. It may be because of pride, or perhaps it’s because of trouble finding the right words. Sometimes, their answers can reveal sharp insights about the problems they are facing.</p>
        <p>Learn to video or photograph your ethnographic research. You can then go back and look at things such as body language and the <strong>environmental interactions that may govern a response</strong> as well as affect how they use your product or service.</p>
        <p>The <strong>easiest way to introduce bias into your research is to have a solution in mind.</strong> It will guide your questioning, observations, and understanding in the direction you want rather than the direction of your users, and you may not even realize it.</p>

        <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-ux-behind-designing-better-forms-d6ebe7a817d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>On UX Design</strong></a></p>
        <p><strong>Align the sections:</strong> Alignment is nothing but arranging text in the most efficient way- allowing for efficient, effective scanning and limiting errors or missed fields. Basically, having the label text as close to the input field makes the grouping more relatable. It is easier to associate them due to their proximity.</p>
        <p><strong>Group related fields:</strong> Grouping information into chunks is an easy way to highlight association. If the form has more than six fields, it is recommended to group them into logical sections. These steps are even more emphasised if each section is given their respective header, and are neatly arranged in a top-down order.</p>
        <p><strong>Write clear labels:</strong> Using succinct and crisp labels. It helps the user understand what information is required in one glance. Avoid using complete sentences to explain simple questions, just one or two words generally suffice.</p>
        <p><strong>Input field format:</strong> design the input fields in a customised manner, which explicitly shows how the information is to be fed in.</p>
        <p><strong>Adding visual cues:</strong> Giving a few suggestions upfront is a good way to get their thoughts running. And representing these options with additional visual cues can turn out to be even better, as it requires minimal cognitive load and provides a direction of thought.</p>
        <p><strong>Optional vs compulsory:</strong> This is a very simple trick to de-clutter a form page. Rather than mentioning ‘compulsory’ next to every header, just put an asterisk and mention the optional ones in words.</p>
        <p><strong>CTA call to action:</strong> CTAs can either look like a solid rectangular button, or a text link. Depending on your use case, make sure that only ONE of them is the prominent one. Mention what’s going to happen once you hit on the button. This clarity is essential for great CTAs.</p>
        <p><strong>Use colours efficiently:</strong> Colours can be cleverly used to direct the user’s attention, and add an aesthetic appeal to the design. The trick is to <strong>stick to not more than 2 main colours in the page</strong>. Just make sure to use them wisely, keeping the main goal of the form in mind.</p>
        <p><strong>Validate the form:</strong> 3 important messages that a good form validation should convey to the user:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an error has occurred. Display clearly that there is an error in the form, preferably using a red color signal to attract attention</li>
            <li>where the error occurred: Highlighting the fields that caused the error</li>
            <li>how the error can be repaired: Provide information on what needs to be different in order for the field to validate</li>

            <li>what will I find when I get there?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Review your Information Architecture:</strong><br>
            Do a user research by using card sorting method. Let your users categorize your IA based on their intuition and their “information scents” to know more on what the users want and how they would like to use the apps. After you did a little research, then you can start building your new IA for your apps.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Start using tab bars:</strong><br>
            So far, the best solution for mobile apps seems to be a tab bar. Either you place it on the top or the bottom of the screen. (It’s up to you where you want to put it. But it would best to put it on top if you are designing for responsive web). When you have your new IA, you can prioritize to use 4–5 icon + text button for your primary navigation options. This is the approach that Facebook has settled for their mobile apps and their apps navigation structure. Here’s their mobile web, iOS apps, and Android apps screenshot for example:
        </p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/hamburger.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-three-quarters-width" src="assets/images/ux/hamburger.png"/></a></p>
        <p>The main benefit of using the icon + text structure is that it allows you to fit in all text while keeping the button size large enough to deal with the big thumbs.<br>
            If you must expand before 5 tabs, the common practice is to use the last tab bar to provide access to the remaining option, similar to the hamburger menu.<br>
            If your desktop apps have a more robust navigation menu, then take the most important elements of your websites and convert them into a tab bar. The other elements can still be available through “more” or “other” tabs. Product Hunt did something interesting with their navigation system. They use a text-based navigation on their mobile and called it “navigation” to replace the hamburger menu.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Other recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>draw a clear line between modal-views and child-views and know when to use which</li>
            <li>only use modal-views for self-contained processes (and fullscreen detail-views in rare occasions)</li>
            <li>use child-views for everything else</li>
            <li>display the tab bar / bottom navigation on every view including child-views</li>
            <li>hide navigation bars (at the top of the screen) and tab bars (at the bottom of the screen) when scrolling down if you want to create focus and maximise screen estate (e.g. for articles, …)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>8 golden rules from Shneiderman +  Nielsen & Mochlich's heuristics = 10 rules of thumb </p>
        <ul>
            <li>visibility of sytem status</li>
            <li>match between system and the real world</li>

            <li>flexibility and effiency of use</li>
            <li>aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
            <li>help users recognise, diagnose and recover from error</li>
            <li>help and documentation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These 10 rules of thumb should only generally be used to inform and inspire a designer’s and a company’s development of their own specific heuristics. In combination with market research, other design guidelines and requirements, using your company or product-specific heuristics will better suit the design under scrutiny</p>
        <p>How to Generate and Conduct Your Own Heuristic Evaluation</p>
        <ul>
            <li>establish an appropriate list of heuristics</li>
            <li>select your evaluators (they should not be your end users) they should have domain expertise</li>
            <li>brief your evaluators :  so they know exactly what they are meant to do and cover during their evaluation. The briefing session should be standardized to ensure the evaluators receive the same instructions; otherwise you may bias their evaluation. </li>
            <li>1st evaluation phase: it generally takes around two hours, depending on the nature and complexity of your product. The evaluators will use the product freely to gain a feel for the methods of interaction and the scope. They will then identify specific elements that they want to evaluate.</li>
            <li>2nd evaluation phase: the evaluators will carry out another run-through, whilst applying the chosen heuristics to the elements identified during the first phase. The evaluators would focus on individual elements and look at how well they fit in the overall design.</li>
            <li>record problems: The evaluators must record problems themselves or you should record them as they carry out their various tasks to track any problems they encounter.</li>
            <li>debriefing session: this involves collaboration between the different evaluators to collate their findings and establish a complete list of problems. They should then be encouraged to suggest potential solutions for these problems on the basis of the heuristics.</li>

        <h3>Hick's Law: Making the choice easier for users</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users?r=stephanie-krus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong></strong></a></p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/hicks.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/hicks.png"/></a></p>
        <p>Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that <strong>the more stimuli (or choices) users face, the longer it will take them to make a decision.</strong> For designers of all types, this presents a challenge, making it imperative to offer the most useful set of options to avoid frustrating the user. This can be vital for safety. The U.S. Navy was quick to recognize the importance of the “Keep It Simple and Straightforward” (“K.I.S.S.”) principle, which reflects Hick’s Law.</p>
        <p>As web designers, we have an important choice to make before presenting users with the choices we hope they will select on our sites. We have to use Hick’s Law in conjunction with other design principles, especially on the landing page to make the most-desired option/s stand out.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, there’s no avoiding complexity, especially if we’re involved with presenting a huge amount of needed information about sophisticated products or intricate services. Using Hick’s Law can help us reduce that complexity by simplifying the decision-making process for our users.</p>
        <p>To make our designs work, we need to remember that a) the user’s time is precious, and b) a user is not obligated to stay on our site. To enhance the user experience, we should consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>categorizing Choice</strong> – Enabling users to find items from higher categories, as if they were looking under sections in a library.</li>
            <li><strong>obscuring Complexity</strong> – Breaking up long or complex processes into screens with fewer options.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once your website or app is live, you can use variables such as “time on site” and “page views” to understand if Hick’s law has been applied correctly.</p>
        <p>Overall, remember that Hick’s Law is a guideline you can adapt to your design. Always try to “flip” the perspective to see the choices you want to present from the outside. Avoid flooding with options, but bear in mind the balance between users’ time and comfort zones for handling options on a page. Guiding them to select between clear options that will get them somewhere quickly (such as a shopping cart) will take the work out of the user experience and reward you both.</p>
        <p>As a user experience designer, you have a great ally in the card-sorting method. Keep in mind that you 1) first need to find out who are your users and what they need, 2) then define the functionalities your product and service will offer to meet these needs, and 3) use methods such as card sorting to build the right categorization and labels for these categories.</p>

        <p>Information architecture design for mobile doesn’t differ dramatically from information architecture design for the desktop. It’s important to research what’s useful on the mobile platform to your users and to try to keep things as simple and manageable as possible. This is true for both the IA and the navigation which directs the user through the IA.</p>
        <p>Handling content on mobile doesn’t need to be a chore but it does take planning.</p>
        <p>In general terms the way you design information architecture (IA) for the mobile environment is very similar to the way that you design the IA for the desktop. The approach you use is near identical in fact but there are some important things to bear in mind when you do so:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>deliver what’s important on the mobile platform: </strong>focus on what’s important to the user when they’re using a smartphone. That doesn’t mean that your users will necessarily be using your app when they’re on the move or on the street – you need to research the way that they will use the app. That, in turn, lets you focus on the content that’s of value to the user and cut down the volume of data that you present on mobile.</li>
            <li><strong>content should be focused on mobile :</strong>  that’s smaller, simpler and easier to handle content than on the desktop. The limit of screen real estate makes large volumes of content more confusing on mobile than on a larger monitor.</li>
            <li><strong>navigation should be simple: </strong>that means limiting the number of menu options and keeping things focused on what’s important to the user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then follow a simple process: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>consider click investment: minimum number of clicks is used to reach the most popular content. Less popular content can be farther away but not too far away. You can reduce levels of frustration with click investment by ensuring that you communicate the process clearly throughout the task</li>
            <li>Keep it simple Stupid (KISS) The simpler things are – the fewer issues with the overall experience. Keep categories to a minimum, keep content and categories together, keep links to a sensible number too, prioritise by popularity, label navigation items clearly and consisely</li>
            <li>think about input devices (for example  0 to 9 as shortcut keys will be better than 1 to 10 as it match the numeric keys on the phone</li>
            <li>provide clear navigational cues (back button, labels etc..</li>

        <h3>IKEA effect</h3>
        <p>The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that can influence the outcome and perceived value of products to a big degree. People tend to place high value on products they partially have created.<br>
            The more the needs for customization and co-production are present in your target audience the more the IKEA effect is relevant for you as a designer. The effect can help you instil feelings of competence in the user when the task is completed successfully.<br>
            The IKEA effect will create stronger bond between the user and the product. The effort that users will put into completing the product to a complete state will transform into love for that product. The subjective value will be higher in comparison to a product that hasn’t cost any effort.
            </p>
        <p>It is important to point out that <strong>the IKEA effect is not about putting the effort be it small or big, it is more about the completion of the task.</strong> The IKEA effect is present when <strong>the user can enjoy the completed task and the product.</strong> If the product is disassembled soon after the assembling the effect is lost.</p>
        <p><strong>Sometimes saving the users a bit of labour could deprive them from a bit more happiness if they were to make the small effort.</strong> Think if you should decrease the user effort to zero or close to zero.</p>
        <p>To make use of the effect we should engage people in the design and increase their sense of product ownership and brand loyalty. This way our designs will be loved more.</p>

        <h3>Interaction design</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-interaction-design?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=sm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>What is Interaction Design?</strong></a></p>
        <p>It is the design of the interaction between users and products. The goal of interaction design is to create products that enable the user to achieve their objective(s) in the best way possible.</p>
        <p><strong>UX design is more than interaction design:</strong> it also involves user research (finding out who the users are in the first place), creating user personas (why, and under what conditions, would they use the product), performing user testing and usability testing, etc.</p>
        <p>The 5 dimensions of interaction design is a useful model to understand what interaction design involves.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>words</strong> like button label, should be meaningful and simple to understand. They should communicate information to users, but not too much information to overwhelm the user.</li>
            <li><strong>visual representations</strong> graphical elements like images, typography and icons that users interact with. These usually supplement the words used to communicate information to users.</li>
            <li><strong>physical objects or space</strong> is the user standing in a crowded train while using the app on a smartphone, or sitting on a desk in the office surfing the website? These all affect the interaction between the user and the product.</li>
            <li><strong>time</strong> refers to media that changes with time (animation, videos, sounds). Motion and sounds play a crucial role in giving visual and audio feedback to users’ interactions. Also of concern is the amount of time a user spends interacting with the product: can users track their progress, or resume their interaction some time later?</li>
            <li><strong>behaviour</strong> how do users perform actions on the website? How do users operate the product? In other words, it’s how the previous dimensions define the interactions of a product. It also includes the reactions—for instance emotional responses or feedback—of users and the product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/5D.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/5D.gif"/></a></p>
        <p>Important questions interaction designers ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>what can a user do with their mouse, finger, or stylus to directly interact with the interface? </li>
            <li>what about the appearance (colour, shape, size, etc.) gives the user a clue about how it may function?</li>
            <li>do error messages provide a way for the user to correct the problem or explain why the error occurred?</li>
            <li>what feedback does a user get once an action is performed?</li>
            <li>are the interface elements a reasonable size to interact with?</li>
            <li>are familiar or standard formats used? </li>
        </ul>
        <p>What do interaction designers do? <br>
        Design strategy which can include doing your own UR>, wireframes that lay out the interactions of the product. In some cases, interactive prototypes are created.</p>

        Lean UX is focused on the experience under design and is less focused on deliverables than traditional UX. It requires a greater level of collaboration with the entire team. The core objective is to focus on obtaining feedback as early as possible so that it can be used to make quick decisions. The nature of Agile development is to work in rapid, iterative cycles and Lean UX mimics these cycles to ensure that data generated can be used in each iteration.</p>

Modal views are only used for short-term tasks that are self-contained processes and can be either completed or candled, like writing a mail, adding an event to a calendar, dismissing a notification, …

        <h3>OKR = Objectives and Key Results</h3>

        <p>It's a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.</p>
        <p>The OKR framework was created by Intel CEO Andy Grove and brought to Google by venture capitalist John Doerr and has been used by several companies including Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Uber.</p>
        <p>The OKR framework aims to define company and team "objectives" along with linked and measurable "key results" to provide "a critical thinking framework and ongoing discipline that seeks to ensure employees work together, focusing their efforts to make measurable contributions." OKRs are typically set at the company, team and personal levels and may be shared across the organization with the intention of providing teams with visibility of goals with the intention to align and focus effort.</p>

        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>Some times it's more useful to look at a user mindset instead of focussing on a user type. This is similar to 'job to be done' strategy.</p>

        <p>Creating personas is a powerful way to make the user group come alive to your design team members and clients. Developing an engaging persona starts with user research. Then, you balance the data you collected with some fictitious information that evokes empathy. When developing a persona, you should strive for a good balance between research data and fictional details to ensure credibility and applicability. Also, the balance between short and to-the-point information, and more elaborate scenarios is important for overview and engagement.</p>
        <p>A good persona includes six main elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>name, age, gender, and an image</li>
            <li>a tag line</li>
            <li>the experience and relevant skills</li>
            <li>some context to indicate the interaction</li>
            <li>any goals, attitudes, and concerns</li>
            <li>quotes or a brief scenario</li>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>comprehension:</strong> all of the information is provided, but it is presented in a way that is not easy to understand. Examples might be on medication labels, or airline boarding passes</li>
            <li><strong>comparison</strong> lots of options presented in the design, but they are not organized in a way that helps the customer make a decision. Examples might be comparing healthcare options, finding a doctor, or attending a conference</li>
            <li><strong>causal relationships</strong> Interaction that allows customers to work through simulations to show cause and effect over time that reveal patterns and help them make better decisions. Some loose examples include exploring the cost of shipping during a checkout process, cost of living or mortgage calculations</li>
            <li><strong>discovery</strong> often with data visualizations, people don’t know the question they want answered. You might have some ideas but you don’t know what you’ll learn. Analytics can fall into this category, as some users won’t know what they want to track</li>
            <li><strong>relationships</strong> getting oriented to a space and understanding the relationships between different topics. Whenever we enter a new space, we are trying to orient ourselves to it. This example could include visual models like sitemaps, concept models or mind maps</li>
            <li><strong>practice</strong> we may understand the elements presented, but we really need to sit down and practice to get better at it</li>
            <li><strong>distributed Cognition</strong> the knowledge you need for understanding a thing is distributed across people, projects, devices, and environments. Ties into service design,could even extend to getting different devices to talk to one another</li>

        <h3>Procurement</h3>
        <p>This is the process of finding, agreeing terms and acquiring goods, services or works from an external source, often via a tendering or competitive bidding process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services or works at the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared. Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimising risk, such as exposure to fraud and collusion.</p>

        <p><strong>What is Rapid Prototyping?</strong><br>
            It is not just wireframes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wireframes are the skeletal structure of user interfaces. It shows the structure, layout, content and functionality of a page.</li>
                <li>Rapid Prototyping is part of the design process after you have a clear grasp of the problem and your users’ needs. At this stage, the designer thinks about what needs to be done to reach the end goal and goes through a series of quick iterations and feedback sessions that could potentially solve the problem.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What you see at the end of a rapid prototyping session are wireframes that you can use to demonstrate the idea but within these ‘wireframes’ are solutions.</p>
            <p>Sketches and rapid prototyping shows others how you think through problems. Your solutions should come to you through sketching, feedback and multiple design iterations.</p>

        <p>There are different situations:</p>
        <p>We know what we are doing, let's not reinvent the wheel. It's ok to do this but you will only design a asolution that 'just does the job'</p>
        <ul>
            <li>strategic: run usability testing with existing audience group on existing website to discover paint points with the current website, measure the basline metrics</li>
            <li>design a solution</li>
            <li>tactical: run usability testing on existing audience to test new solution. iterate. Test. Repeat.</li>
            <li>operational: set up operational metrics on the new site</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Including adjacencies, this widen the net slightly and provides richer data</p>
        <ul>
            <li>strategic: start with the known and work outwards</li>
            <li>run usability testing with adjacent or target audience groups on existing website to discover what pain points they face with the current website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Non linear, you build the obvious and you go beyond that</p>
    <ul>
        <li>exploratory and strategic: start with the known and work outwards. Then figure out the broader ecosystem using non standard methodologies.</li>
        <li>strategic: start with examples as before, and then move onto ...</li>
        <li>exploratory: understand the problem and the bigger picture not just the website, so you know what other probles you could solve with the website</li>

        <p>Responsive design is a way of developing web properties so that the device they are used on determines the way that the site will be displayed. It’s normally done using the principle “mobile first” – i.e. the experience is defined on mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets and then scaled up to larger screens.</p>

        <p>Service designers aim to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>understand thoroughly the service proposition of the organisation or company in question</li>
            <li>discern the needs of all the stakeholders and actors in a service — both customers and service providers</li>
            <li>map out the service through a service ecology, service blueprint, and user journeys</li>
            <li>co-create possible solutions or improvements by collaborating with service stakeholders</li>
            <li>prototype and pilot new service experiences with real customers and staff</li>
            <li>zoom in and out constantly between the details of individual touchpoints and the design of the overall service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Service design starts by looking to make improvement in people, processes, assets and culture. That then indirectly goes on to influence the customer experience.</p>

        <p>This is a cognitive mapping technique, the instruction was: ‘draw your digital life’, every one of them starting scribbling immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Extract the map:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>give interviewee a stack of blank paper and a black pen</li>
            <li>choose two more pens in contrasting colours dark enough to show up in a scan, and keep these to one side</li>
            <li>tell them: ‘You’ve got 6 minutes to draw [concept]. Just doodle whatever that means to you, you can’t get it wrong. Include anything you want: objects, people, shapes, scribbles, even a few words if you need to label something you’ve drawn. You’ll be using these three pens and you get two minutes with each pen. I’ll hand you a new pen when it’s time to switch. Ready? Go!’</li>
            <li>start a silent timer, shut up, and try to be inconspicuous</li>
            <li>after 2 minutes, and again after 4 minutes, gently take the pen they’re using and give them the next one</li>
            <li>tell them when they’ve got 20 seconds left.</li>
            <li>if they’re still scribbling at 6 minutes, give them a few more seconds to finish what they’re doing</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Use the map to navigate the interview</strong><br>
            Once the pens are capped, thank the interviewee for being up for it and ask them if they’d like to explain what they’ve drawn.
        </p>
        <p>As they talk, prompt for extra details when needed but don’t try to guide them at all. If they skip over part of the drawing then go back to it at the end with a simple “What’s this bit?” Don’t speculate - let everything be in their words.</p>
        <p><strong>Why 3 pens? And why 2 minutes per pen?</strong><br>
            This helps us understand the participant’s priorities and thought processes.
        </p>
        <p>Whatever came into their head first is likely to be the most central, fundamental thing they associate with the concept. We can see what that is because it’s drawn in black.</p>
        <p>If they had any last minute flurries of inspiration on hearing there were only 20 seconds left, these will be drawn in the third colour.</p>
        <p>And the ways the 3 colours overlap — or don’t — hints at how they went about breaking the concept down in their head. Once we know whether they were thinking chronologically, in categories, or simply scattergunning, we can tailor our questions appropriately.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>time on task</li>
            <li>success/failure rates  <strong>(number one metric captured in UT)</strong> = ease of use</li>
            <li>do they get the task (success rate) do they not (failure rate), do they get part of it (partial success)</li>
            <li>effort: e.g. number of clicks / perception of progress</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Qualitative</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>stress responses (looking at their face, change in body language)</li>
            <li>subjective satisfaction (a questionnaire about how well they think they did)</li>
            <li>perceived effort or difficulty</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4 steps</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>create test plan: </strong>recruit the users, define the test scope, identify objectives, establish metrics</li>
            <li><strong>facilitate test: </strong>observe users, identify issues, identify solutions, interview users</li>
            <li><strong>analyse test data: </strong>assess user behaviour, analyse user click path. identify problem areas, assess navigation</li>
            <li><strong>create test report</strong>review video footage, identify design issues, identify best practices, design recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why metrics: </p>

        <p><strong>Usability Testing and Moderating Skills Why do we test by scenario?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>more realism with real world behaviour</li>
            <li>to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for the test participant</li>
            <li>so we don't give away what we are testing</li>
            <li>so <strong>we don't lead the witness</strong>, we need to be a bit obscure and not use the vocabulary of the product</li>
            <li>scenario simulate real-life the closest</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conduct a pilot test:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>always conduct a live fire test the day before to iron out any issues</li>
            <li>for mobile testing: always test reception in the room or the area you will be testing in </li>
            <li>make sure lightning is ok for the screen of the device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why think aloud? </strong>Asking users to think aloud helps you track their thought patterns. This becomes the running commentary on task performance (which you observe and take notes on). Remind them that we are testing the interface, not them. </p>
        <p>We are observers, we do not talk. Even if the user is asking us something, if we do not respond they will usually move on. We can say ok, or uh huh, but not good or bad. Need to stay neutral. You can use reverse questions (is this what you were expecting?).</p>

        <h3>User Centered Design</h3>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ucd.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/ucd.png"/></a></p>
        <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/user-centered-design-process-and-benefits-fd9e431eb5a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>User-Centered Design: Process and Benefits</strong></a></p>
        <p>User-centered design creates a unique chance to design together with communities. User-centered designers deeply understand the folks they’re trying to serve. They create lots of ideas and make innovative new products rooted in people’s actual needs.</p>
        <p>To design in a user-centric way identify the people who will use the product, what they’ll use it for, and the conditions under which they will use it. Observe people’s lives, hear their hopes and needs, and get smart about your challenge.</p>
        <p><strong>User-centered design process goes through six phases:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>specify the use context and users’ needs</li>
            <li>specify business requirements</li>
            <li>build design solutions from rough concept to finished design</li>
            <li>evaluate designs with usability testing</li>
            <li>implementation — develop and deliver the product</li>
            <li>deployment — the final product is evaluated, as consumer needs change</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Responsive principles of user-centered design:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>clear understanding of the users, tasks and environments</li>
            <li>evaluation-driven design</li>
            <li>considering the general consumer experience</li>
            <li>involving the client within the design process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>User-centered designers test, fail and try once more. This method combines analysis, interviews, generative strategies, and tools like group action. UCD, for the most part, develops an understanding of the user’s desires through the inclusion of users at all stages of the designing and testing. We rely on feedback from everybody in the group. Iteration keeps design process responsive.</p>
        <p>In user-centered design, you have to be comfortable with the idea of failure and celebrate the learning which it brings. You try something out, maybe pushing too far, or you want to learn from an experiment. And your half-baked idea didn’t quite work out how you expected. But in some ways, <strong>the learning that came from that unexpected failure was more valuable than the success might have been.</strong></p>
        <p>When it comes to implementation, that’s when you don’t want quite as much failure to happen. Because <dtrong>the process starts getting more expensive</dtrong>. You’ll be putting all your effort into making something. But even then you need to be constantly experimenting and refining. So <strong>with user-centered design even in case of failure you continue to prototype and improve your UX. With user-centered desig</strong>n, you will not have avoidable rework or even worse a big failure right at the end. Because UCD identifies problems before they emerge.</p>

        <p>All the interactions a customer will have with an organisation throughout their customer lifecycle.<br>
            If you want your teams to remember what really matters to your customers – their <strong>Moments of Truth</strong>, their delights, and what frustrates them – then communicating this pictorially is far more effective than doing it through text.<br>
            A strong visual help teams understand and retain your message.<br>
            So the next time you want to engage your teams in an effort to drive customer-focused change, take the time to engage a graphic designer to ensure you’re effectively communicating your message. Your employees will thank you. And, once they act on the information, so will your customers.

            <p class="lead">Walking a Mile in Your Customer’s Shoes</p>
            <p>Customer journey maps can be useful beyond the UX design and marketing teams. They can help facilitate a common business understanding of how every customer should be treated across all sales, logistics, distribution, care, etc. channels. This in turn can help break down “organizational silos” and start a process of wider customer-focused communication in a business.</p>
            <p><strong>They may also be employed to educate stakeholders as to what customers perceive when they interact with the business. They help them explore what customers think, feel, see, hear and do and also raise some interesting “what ifs” and the possible answers to them.</strong></p>
            <p>A customer journey map is a very simple idea: a diagram that illustrates the steps your customer(s) go through in engaging with your company, whether it be a product, an online experience, retail experience, or a service, or any combination. The more touchpoints you have, the more complicated — but necessary — such a map becomes. Sometimes customer journey maps are “cradle to grave,” looking at the entire arc of engagement.</p>
        
            <p class="lead">What Do You Need to Do to Create a Customer Journey Map?</p>
            <p>Firstly, you will need to do some preparation prior to beginning your journey maps ideally you should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>user-personas</strong> - If you can’t tell a typical user’s story, how will you know if you’ve captured their journey?</li>
                <li><strong>a timescale</strong> - Customer journeys can take place in a week, a year, a lifetime, etc. and it’s useful to know what length of journey you will measure before you begin</li>
                <li><strong>a clear understanding of customer touchpoints</strong> - What is your customer doing and how are they doing it?</li>
                <li><strong>a clear understanding of the channels in which actions occur</strong> - Channels are the places where customers interact with the business – from Facebook pages to retail stores. This helps you understand what your customers are actually doing</li>
                <li><strong>an understanding of any other actors that might alter the customer experience</strong> - For example, friends, family, colleagues, etc. that may influence the way a customer feels about any given interaction</li>
                <li><strong>a plan for “moments of truth”</strong> – the positive interactions that create good feelings in customers that can be used at touchpoints where frustrations exist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you’ve done your preparation you can follow a simple 8 point process to develop your customer journey maps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>review organization objectives</strong> – what are your goals for this mapping exercise? What organizational needs do you intend to meet?</li>
                <li><strong>review current research</strong> – the more user research you have at your fingertips, the easier this exercise will be. Be creative and if you don’t have the right research to define the journey – consider how you can carry that research out</li>
                <li><strong>review touchpoints and channels</strong> – the next step is to ensure that touchpoints and channels are effectively mapped. So for example a touchpoint could be “pay this invoice” and channels could be “online”, “retail”, “over the phone”, “mail”, etc. It can also help to brainstorm at this stage and see if there are any touchpoints or channels you’ve missed in your original data collection exercise</li>
                <li><strong>create an empathy map</strong> - An empathy map examines how the customer feels during each interaction – you want to concentrate on how the customer feels and thinks as well as what they will say, do, hear, etc. in any given situation</li>
                <li><strong>build an affinity diagram</strong> - The idea here is to first brainstorm around each concept you’ve touched on and then to create a diagram which relates all these concepts, feelings, etc. together. This is best achieved by grouping ideas in categories and labeling them. You can eliminate concepts, etc. which don’t seem to have any impact on customer experience at this stage too</li>
                <li><strong>sketch the customer journey</strong> - How you do this is up to you; you can build a nice timeline map that brings together the journey over the course of time. You could also turn the idea into a video or an audio clip or use a completely different style of diagram. The idea is simply to show the motion of a customer through touchpoints and channels across your time period and how they feel about each interaction on that journey</li>
                <li><strong>iterate and produce</strong> - Then take your sketches and make them into something useful, keep refining the content and then produce something that is visually appealing and useful to stakeholders, team members, etc. Don’t be afraid to rope in a graphic designer at this stage if you’re not good at making things look awesome</li>
                <li><strong>distribute and utilise</strong> - The journey maps is no use sat on your hard drive or in your desk drawer – you need to get it out there to people and explain why it’s important. Then it needs to be put to use, you should be able to define KPIs around the ideal journey, for example, and then measure future success as you improve the journey</li>

        <p><strong>When to do User Research</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>user research fits into the development process on all stages, depending on why you want to do user research</li>
            <li>when and what type depends on what work process looks like</li>
            <li>if UCD process, then UR is an integrated part of the process</li>
            <li>if not UCD than it's up to you to be smart about when and how to research</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Rules of thumb</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>the sooner the better (ideally start before development)</li>
            <li>do the user research you can where you are</li>
            <li>be proactive rather than reactive</li>
            <li>prioritise your efforts</li>
            <li>be open to changing the end goal</li>
            <li>be prepared to go small but not too small</li>
            <li>only do user research if it can have an impact</li>     
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to Involve Stakeholders in Your User Research</strong><br>
            When you plan a user research project, involving your stakeholders is vital. They can provide you with information about the project and ensure that you don’t do irrelevant work or waste time doing a duplicate study. Talking to stakeholders also gives you an opportunity to engage them in your project. In small companies, knowing whom to talk to and what to ask is straightforward; however, in bigger projects, you have to consider different types of stakeholders. The best way to involve stakeholders is often to do informal interviews asking what they know about the project, how they are involved in the project, what the history of the project is, and how users/customers have already been involved. With stakeholders fully on board with your project, you can go practically anywhere and navigate around obstacles that would otherwise block your progress.

        <h3>User stories = As a , I want to, so that</h3>
        <p>User stories are a simple tool for articulating the user’s perspective. They are not long, wordy stories to be told around a camp fire but rather short (often only a single sentence) descriptions of what a user will do with a part of a system. They are written in plain English or in the language of the business in which they will be used and require no special literary gifts or linguistic talents to compose.</p>
        <p>They are particularly important in Agile environments where they facilitate the functionality of a system but can be used in any environment to ensure that design and development are focused on user needs. They deliver the “who”, “what” and “why” of user requirements in a format that can be easily understood by anyone who needs to use them.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits of Using User Stories in Design and Development</strong><br>
                There are several benefits of using user stories in design and development cycles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>simple and quick to understand</li>
            <li>allow programmers to quickly (using agile) implement customer/user value</li>
            <li>don’t need very much maintenance</li>
            <li>can be discounted except when they are being used in development</li>
            <li>allow a project to be chunked into smaller milestones</li>
            <li>make it easier to estimate costs on a project for development</li>
            <li>facilitate cooperative working with clients and users</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Drawbacks of Using User Stories in Design and Development</strong><br>
            There are possible drawbacks of using user stories and in particular of becoming overly-reliant on them at the expense of other tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>difficult to work into large scale projects (where thousands of stories might be required)</li>
            <li>may be too vague to be useful and require a lot of back and forth between developers and clients</li>
            <li>fail to capture performance measurements and sometimes non-functional aspects of the system – e.g. they are too simple</li>

        <h3>UI</h3>
        <p>Simply put, UI is how things look, UX is how things work. UX is a process, while UI is a deliverable.</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ui.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/ui.png"/></a></p>
        <p>As a UI designer, your goal is to create a user interface that is engaging, beautiful, and also creates an emotional response from the user to make your products more lovable and beautiful.</p>
        <p>When I started out, something I learned from my mentor is to take a tour guide journey to your product. Imagine your app/website as a journey. Every user that downloads your app right from spotting it in the App Store/web, through using it, achieving goals or completing tasks within the app is taken on a journey. And that journey should be a delightful one.</p>
        <p><strong>Alignment</strong> is a fundamental aspect of UI Design. And an important design principle is: minimize the number of alignment lines. It improves readibility and makes the design more pleasing to the eye.<br>
            There are two fundamental types of alignment: Edge alignment and Center alignment.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>edge alignment: all the elements having one side or edge lining up with a single line</li>
            <li>center alignment: you line up all the elements by their midpoint</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Become an attention architect.</strong>Here’s two ways to interpret this: you need to </p>
        <ol>
            <li>grab the user’s attention with your design</li>
            <li>pay attention to every little thing in your designs</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To be a great designer, you need to do both. The latter lets you achieve the former.</p>
        <p>UI Design is about tailoring the experience for your users by guiding their attention towards different important things.</p>
        <p class="lead">Ways to use text to grab user’s attention:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>make its size larger or smaller</li>
            <li>bolder or brighter in color. Or make it muted</li>
            <li>use a typeface with a heavy weighting versus something that is thin or light</li>
            <li>italicize words. Capitalise or lowercase some words</li>
            <li>increase the distance between each of the letters to make the overall size of the words take up more space</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most important thing when designing is testing! Make sure you try out different everything: colors, fonts, tones, angles, alignment, layout, etc. Experiment with different designs so that you can architect a user journey using various ways of commanding attention.</p>

        <p>Voice User Interface design is a promising brand new field which provides solutions through voice control. With VUI and GUI combined, human-machine interaction can be enhanced and streamlined using input via facial expressions, gestures, and audio.</p>
        <p>Combining GUI and VUI presents challenges:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>coordinate voice and gesture input</li>
                <li>determine whether to speak or display</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Combining GUI and VUI has benefits:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>leverage advantages of both GUI and VUI</li>
                <li>user convenience</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Plan and develop carefully:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>user test, test, and test some more</li>

        <h3>White space</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space?r=stephanie-krus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The power of white space</strong></a></p>
        <p>White space (negative space) is the area between design elements. It's another tool for designers to design for the user experience (UX). Remember that white space is not necessarily white; it’s just the name to indicate spaces where there are neither user interface (UI) elements nor specific content.</p>
        <p>As a designer, you can introduce white space based on four main factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>content</li>
          <li>design</li>
          <li>user</li>
          <li>brand</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use <strong>macro white space</strong> to organize content in the layout and direct the user through the blocks of content shown. Use <strong>micro white space</strong> inside the design element features as seen in the text, images and content blocks.</p>
        <p>We can also approach white space as being <strong>passive or active</strong>. Passive white space does not have a specific role in the design other than facilitating the user experience. It is all about being easier to read. Active white space guides the focus and attention of users. It is more about standing out and making a statement.</p>

        <a name="wire"></a>
        <h3>Wireframe</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>blueprint for a site or app layout</li>
          <li>show important functionality</li>
          <li>conveys content type and grouping </li>
          <li>show information hierarchy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They quickly generate ideas, aids discussion, show content hierarchy and establish key functionality.<br>
            They can be static, code-based, for layout, information architecture or wireflow. <br>
            Static: They are quick to create, there is a variety of tools and software but wireframe are not responsive.<br>
            code-based one are: responsive, interactive, in the browser but they can take longer to do, require coding knowledge, and might be difficult to interprete.
            </p>
        <p>For example below with Adobe Illustrator: show real content (Static)</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe1.png"/></a></p>
        <p><strong>wireflow (= hydrid of flow chart + wireframe)</strong></p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe2.png"/></a></p>
        <p>Balsamic, Omnigraffle, InVision, Sktech, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop Adobe XD (static wireframe)<br>
                Axure, Pattern Lab, GTML and CSS (code based wireframe)<br>
                High fidelity can be harder to understand for less technical people or can be confused with the real thing.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Annotations: </strong><br>
            Add labels to important features<br>
            Explain Key functionality<br>
            what happens in different states<br>
            Anything that isn't self explanatory
            </p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe3.png"/></a></p>
        <p>Wireframe appear very early in the design process.<br>
            Consideration to have: content needs, purpose, audience, fidelity, tools, annotation and documentation.<br>
            Wireframe planning: define the main purpose, what type of information is needed, what functionality is necessary and assign priority<br>        
            You can purchases components to make quicks wireframes: uxkits.com<br>
            To start, you ideally need: some discovery brief, competitive analysis, UR reports, Analytics, Site maps, Technical requirements, SEO recommendations, User personas
