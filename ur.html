            <p><strong>When to do User Research</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>user research fits into the development process on all stages, depending on why you want to do user research</li>
                <li>when and what type depends on what work process looks like</li>
                <li>if UCD process, then UR is an integrated part of the process</li>
                <li>if not UCD than it's up to you to be smart about when and how to research</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Rules of thumb</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>the sooner the better (ideally start before development)</li>
                <li>do the user research you can where you are</li>
                <li>be proactive rather than reactive</li>
                <li>prioritise your efforts</li>
                <li>be open to changing the end goal</li>
                <li>be prepared to go small but not too small</li>
                <li>only do user research if it can have an impact</li>     
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Involve Stakeholders in Your User Research</strong><br>
                When you plan a user research project, involving your stakeholders is vital. They can provide you with information about the project and ensure that you don’t do irrelevant work or waste time doing a duplicate study. Talking to stakeholders also gives you an opportunity to engage them in your project. In small companies, knowing whom to talk to and what to ask is straightforward; however, in bigger projects, you have to consider different types of stakeholders. The best way to involve stakeholders is often to do informal interviews asking what they know about the project, how they are involved in the project, what the history of the project is, and how users/customers have already been involved. With stakeholders fully on board with your project, you can go practically anywhere and navigate around obstacles that would otherwise block your progress.

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Get comfortable being uncomfortable</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Ask first, prototype later</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Know your goal</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Agree on the big questions</strong></li>
                <li><strong>There is always enough time and money</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Don’t expect data to change minds:</strong><br>
                    The whole point of gathering evidence is to make evidence-based decisions. If that evidence undermines or contradicts the ideas of beliefs of the person with authority to make decisions, they will find reasons to reject it or ignore it. This is also at the heart of why qualitative researchers have a hard time in some engineering-driven organizations. People who are comfortable and competent with numbers want answers in numbers, even if the question demands something more descriptive.<br>
                    So you have to turn ethnography inward and learn how your peers and leaders make decisions before you try to use data to influence those decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace messy imperfection</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Commit to collaboration: </strong><br>
                    Research without collaboration means that one group of people is learning and creating reports for another group to acknowledge and ignore. Knowledge leaks out of even the most well-meaning teams working like this. Collaboration without evidence means everyone has tacitly agreed whose personal preferences win. Neither of these is the most productive approach.<br>
                    Directly involving the people creating the product in asking and answering the questions is the most productive approach. Plus it’s fun. </li>
                <li><strong>Find your bias buddies</strong></li>
            </ol>

        <h3>5 Whys</h3>
        <p>Quite literally, asking your users “Why?” whenever they explain their behaviours to you. Each time you ask “Why?”, you will prompt someone to re-evaluate their position in order to dig a little deeper into their own reasoning. It may seem a little odd to keep asking “Why?” at first, but it will bring great insights while allowing you to dig deeper in order to find the root cause(s) of their behaviours.</p>

        <p>In UX, the method is used to organise research findings or to sort design ideas in ideation workshops, it should be quick and collaborative.</p>
        <p>2 steps</p>
        <ul>
            <li>generating sticky notes (during ideations workshop or usability testing session)</li>
            <li>organising them in groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We need to keep moving, it can be long, needs to be facilitated, encourage participant, set priorities.<br>
            Need a big wall, all notes on it no specific order<br>
            Create categories names, either before or if they emerge
        </p>
        <p>The general steps we’ll follow are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sort into top-level categories</li>
            <li>sort each of those categories into subcategories</li>
            <li>summarize those categories</li>
            <li>determine priorities (e.g., by taking votes)</li>
            <li>plan subsequent design meetings as needed</li>
            <li>no talking as you sort, please. It gets distracting and makes the process take longer. This meeting should take not more than 3 (usually 2) hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Look for a category which makes sense, if none, create one and tell the others<br>
            Yell the new category name<br>
            If note is not clear, put in the ? category<br>
            If similar notes, stack them, most descriptive on top.
        </p>
        <p>Then divide categories in subcategories, on or two person per category<br>
            Present the category you sorted<br>
            Find the priorities (either use a scale, or people put points on them, each get 3)<br>
            Or 100$. value different ideas, total of price of ideas will be $100 <br>
            Or NUF: New Useful and Feasible: 1 to 7 for each attribute, then total and the idea with higher total has the priority. (newer is better)
        </p>
        <p>Write main point on a flipchart, take photos of the walls<br>
            Assign follow up task<br>
            Announce a written report about this<br>
            Announce next design workshop meeting will be scheduled
        </p>
        <p>Time will depend on nb of post its, number of attendee and if they are new to the concept or not. <strong>Max 3 hours!</strong></p>

        <p>UX workshops have <strong>numerous benefits</strong>: educate people and make them empathic towards users, make stakeholders feel involved and responsible for ideas and research findings, create awareness of usability issues and design challenges, build common ground across all parties involved, and bring together many types of backgrounds and expertise.</p>
        <p>However, in such UX workshops, it <strong>can be challenging</strong> to engaging the team, and creating order among diverse ideas and facts.</p>
        <p>I used to think that, as a user researcher, my job was to make the information I collected about users as understandable and digestible as possible for my team. And as a designer, I was supposed to come up with the best design solution. While I still feel these things are true, I have learned that <strong>insulating stakeholders from all the false starts, design ideas, details and messy notes taken in tests does them a disservice</strong>. To educate other team members, involve them in design, <strong>build consensus, and increase sensitivity to usability issues</strong>, get them involved in taking notes, sorting them, and discussing them rather that protecting them from these processes.</p>

        <p>A service blueprint is always constructed from the customer's perspective. A typical service blueprint identifies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Customer Actions:</strong> The steps that customers take as part of the service delivery process.</li>
                <li><strong>Front-stage (Visible Contact Employee) Actions:</strong> Steps taken by contact employees as part of the face-to-face service encounter</li>
                <li><strong>Back-stage (Invisible Contact Employee) Actions:</strong> (The 'line of visibility' separates the front-stage and back-stage actions). Non-visible steps taken by contact employees behind the line of visibility. e.g. taking a hotel or restaurant reservation by telephone</li>
                <li><strong>Support Processes:</strong> Activities carried out by employees who are not contact employees, but whose actions are required for the service to be delivered</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Evidence:</strong> Tangible elements associated with each step that has the potential to influence customer perceptions of the service encounter e.g. uniforms, delivery vans</li>

        <p>When working in UX, one learns that users don’t read. They’ll skim content, jumping from headline to headline. They’ll dismiss modals and messages without reading them, and ignore the blindingly obvious in favour of the task they’re trying to achieve.<br>
        This implies that few users will read notices about the use of cookies on a website, let alone dive into lengthy legalese privacy and data use policies — if they even understand the implications of what they’re reading.
        </p>
        <p>If we choose to track user activity, users should be able to choose whether or not to participate. Informed consent should be a requirement for certain types of tracking for UX research.</p>

        <h3>Ethnographic Research</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/7-simple-ways-to-get-better-results-from-ethnographic-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>7 Simple Ways to Get Better Results from Ethnographic Research</strong></a></p>
        <p>Ethnographic research, such as user observation and interviews, will allow you to discover who your users really are, and the environments in which they live. It will provide great insights into the way that your users will interact with your product.<br>
            There are specific challenges associated with ethnographic research—the main one being that it’s not a quantitative process. You don’t end up with neat numbers, graphs, and figures. Instead, it’s a qualitative process, which involves producing a great deal of unruly data that is hard to summarize. It is also difficult, and some would say impossible, not to let your own biases or assumptions sneak into the research process.<br>
            It’s important to focus on and empathise with the people you design for, and truly listen to and understand them, rather than concentrating on your expected process outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>You need to be aware of potential sources of bias and take care to eliminate them. You will also need as <strong>diverse a team</strong> as possible in order to obtain the best insights.</p>
        <p>Take time to <strong>introduce yourself, explain what’s going to happen, and invite questions from the start</strong>. Try to illustrate through the process that what the person is saying/doing is important and of value to you.</p>
        <p>Rather than guessing or assuming the reasons behind people’s behaviour—you should <strong>ask the people to explain things for themselves.</strong> You should listen to the answer, figure out what is not being said, and observe their body language. It may be because of pride, or perhaps it’s because of trouble finding the right words. Sometimes, their answers can reveal sharp insights about the problems they are facing.</p>
        <p>Learn to video or photograph your ethnographic research. You can then go back and look at things such as body language and the <strong>environmental interactions that may govern a response</strong> as well as affect how they use your product or service.</p>
        <p>The <strong>easiest way to introduce bias into your research is to have a solution in mind.</strong> It will guide your questioning, observations, and understanding in the direction you want rather than the direction of your users, and you may not even realize it.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/creating-personas-from-user-research-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Creating Personas from User Research Results</strong></a></p>
        <p>Creating personas is a powerful way to make the user group come alive to your design team members and clients. Developing an engaging persona starts with user research. Then, you balance the data you collected with some fictitious information that evokes empathy. When developing a persona, you should strive for a good balance between research data and fictional details to ensure credibility and applicability. Also, the balance between short and to-the-point information, and more elaborate scenarios is important for overview and engagement.</p>
        <p>A good persona includes six main elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>name, age, gender, and an image or not... more and more advise against having a photo</li>
            <li>a tag line</li>
            <li>the experience and relevant skills</li>
            <li>some context to indicate the interaction</li>
            <li>any goals, attitudes, and concerns</li>
            <li>quotes or a brief scenario</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More tips for demographic-free persona building:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>no photos: Sophie Dennis has observed “One client used a photo of a young blonde-haired woman. That persona would get dismissed as ‘The Blonde.’”</li>
            <li>use gender-neutral names, or no names at all, and write bios in the first person</li>
            <li>phrase the thinking styles so that users would be happy to identify with them</li>
            <li>understand that one person can switch between multiple thinking styles depending on the circumstances</li>

        <h3>Personalisation</h3>
        <p><a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/guiding-principles-for-providing-remember-me-personalization/?item=ux-writing-the-case-for-user-centric-language%2F#/main/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Guiding Principles for Providing “Remember Me” Personalization</strong></a></p>
        <p>A three-pronged approach: examining our past user research, our customers, and our competition.</p>
        <p>Previous studies gave us insight into the way customers view their account information: specifically, <strong>what personal information they consider private, semi-private, or non-private</strong>.<br>
            We met with our in-house privacy expert and with a leading technology and market research company to understand what business issues might arise as a result of “remember me” personalization. They were unaware of companies facing legal problems resulting from privacy issues related to personalization; however, both experts acknowledged that some businesses have encountered challenges from a public relations perspective.<br>
            Finally, we studied how direct competitors, secondary competitors, and major sites outside our industry are using “remember me” personalization by performing a detailed competitive analysis. We discovered that choosing to be “remembered” means different things on different sites. At one end of the spectrum, it’s like an automatic sign in, enabling full access to account/personal information. The other end involves little more than a username pre-fill, allowing for quicker sign in.<br>    
            What <strong>we learned—it’s a jungle out there</strong>.We developed the Guiding Principles: general guidelines for creating “remember me” personalisation that’s effective both from the customer and business perspective.<br>
            <strong>We discovered that there are virtually no established standards or guidelines for “remember me” personalization.</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>The Guiding Principles</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Communicate openly and clearly about security and privacy</li>
                <p>Address customers’ concerns, and do it in context—for example, when they are signing in or being asked for information.</p>
                <p>Customers want to know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How the site uses cookies, web pixels, and related technologies, explained in a way they understand.</li>
                    <li>Why the site wants or requires personal information.</li>
                    <li>What personal information is collected.</li>
                    <li>What cookies are set and what these cookies are called.</li>
                    <li>What is in each cookie.</li>
                    <li>How personal information will be used by the site and third parties, and who these third parties are.</li>
                    <li>How users can access their personal information.</li>
                    <li>Options for controlling how personal information is used.</li>
                    <li>How personal information will be protected.</li>            
                </ul> <br><br>

                <li>Explain the value of personalization to customers</li>
                <p>Customers should always get something from personalization, and the benefits should be proportional to the amount of personal information they provide. Make it clear what they will get in exchange for their personal information.</p>
                <br>
                <li>Build customer trust</li>
                <p>There are many ways to do this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How the site uses cookies, web pixels, and related technologies, explained in a way they understand</li>
                    <li>Why the site wants or requires personal information</li>
                    <li>What personal information is collected</li>
                    <li>What cookies are set and what these cookies are called</li>
                    <li>What is in each cookie</li>
                    <li>How personal information will be used by the site and third parties, and who these third parties are.</li>
                    <li>How users can access their personal information</li>
                    <li>Options for controlling how personal information is used</li>
                    <li>How personal information will be protected</li>
                </ul> <br><br>
               
                <li>Give customers flexibility and control</li>
                <p>Allow them to opt out of being remembered at any time. Make it clear how to do that and make it simple:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide well-marked paths and landmarks</li>
                    <li>Offer reliable visual cues for context</li>
                    <li>Keep them informed so they do not enter into an experience unwittingly</li>
                    <li>Make actions reversible so they do not make irrecoverable changes</li>
                    <li>Always allow a way out, but make it easier to stay in</li>
                </ul> <br><br>
     
                
                <li>Make customer participation in personalization seamless, but obvious</li>
                <p>Give customers options for personalizing content and gather information iteratively at appropriate times, offering feedback and “gentle reminders” prompting them to update personal information. Make it easy for them to provide information, but make sure that will be a conscious decision by the customer.</p>
                <br>
                <li>Provide personalization whenever possible, as long as it is relevant</li>
                <p>Use personalization to enhance the customer’s relationship with the site, and keep it in the context of what the customer is doing while on the site. Ensure that “remember me” personalization supports the mission and purpose of the website.</p>
                <br>
                <li>Test “remember me” functionality to ensure it works and is usable</li>
                <p>Make sure the functionality works the way it’s supposed to.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide clear visual and verbal cues that reveal the customer’s status: remembered, signed in, or not recognized</li>
                    <li>Make sure visual and verbal cues match the site’s performance, i.e., no “sign out” link for “cookied” customers because they are not signed in</li>
                    <li>Differentiate the “remember me” feature from sign in</li>
                </ul> <br><br>
                <li>Make sure that “remember me” personalization provides good ROI before implementing</li>
                <p>Check with customers to ensure that personalization you provide has value, and to determine ways to improve it. Review site statistics related to use of personalization, such as the number of users who check “remember me.” When planning enhancements to personalization, set metrics and then track results.</p>
                <br>
                <li>Before providing personalization, consult with the legal department</li>
                <p>Know the company’s policies regarding personal information and be aware of any past situations involving the company or the company’s industry that may have caused legal problems. Watch for emerging guidelines and best practices related to personalization.</p>

        <p>This isn’t really about blind men and elephants. It’s about seeing the big picture in our research. The blind men offer us a useful metaphor for what we can’t see when we’re not looking for it.<br>
            That means as user researchers we want to try and use meaningful samples sizes in our research to get the opinion of enough “blind men” to be relevant. Then we need to ensure that our research offers enough balance so that we can determine what people say and what they do. We need both qualitative and quantitative data to provide real insight. We need to keep an eye on the picture in case it changes and that means developing a rhythm to our research so that it is constantly evolving that picture.<br>         
            We need to work with everyone involved with users to ensure that we are not “blind men” ourselves and finally we need to bring all the data generated together into one place so that we can develop that big picture and share it with others who need it. Only then can we see the elephant.

        <p>This is a cognitive mapping technique, the instruction was: ‘draw your digital life’, every one of them starting scribbling immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Extract the map:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>give interviewee a stack of blank paper and a black pen</li>
            <li>choose two more pens in contrasting colours dark enough to show up in a scan, and keep these to one side</li>
            <li>tell them: ‘You’ve got 6 minutes to draw [concept]. Just doodle whatever that means to you, you can’t get it wrong. Include anything you want: objects, people, shapes, scribbles, even a few words if you need to label something you’ve drawn. You’ll be using these three pens and you get two minutes with each pen. I’ll hand you a new pen when it’s time to switch. Ready? Go!’</li>
            <li>start a silent timer, shut up, and try to be inconspicuous</li>
            <li>after 2 minutes, and again after 4 minutes, gently take the pen they’re using and give them the next one</li>
            <li>tell them when they’ve got 20 seconds left.</li>
            <li>if they’re still scribbling at 6 minutes, give them a few more seconds to finish what they’re doing</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Use the map to navigate the interview</strong><br>
            Once the pens are capped, thank the interviewee for being up for it and ask them if they’d like to explain what they’ve drawn.
        </p>
        <p>As they talk, prompt for extra details when needed but don’t try to guide them at all. If they skip over part of the drawing then go back to it at the end with a simple “What’s this bit?” Don’t speculate - let everything be in their words.</p>
        <p><strong>Why 3 pens? And why 2 minutes per pen?</strong><br>
            This helps us understand the participant’s priorities and thought processes.
        </p>
        <p>Whatever came into their head first is likely to be the most central, fundamental thing they associate with the concept. We can see what that is because it’s drawn in black.</p>
        <p>If they had any last minute flurries of inspiration on hearing there were only 20 seconds left, these will be drawn in the third colour.</p>
        <p>And the ways the 3 colours overlap — or don’t — hints at how they went about breaking the concept down in their head. Once we know whether they were thinking chronologically, in categories, or simply scattergunning, we can tailor our questions appropriately.</p>

        <p>All the interactions a customer will have with an organisation throughout their customer lifecycle.<br>
            If you want your teams to remember what really matters to your customers – their <strong>Moments of Truth</strong>, their delights, and what frustrates them – then communicating this pictorially is far more effective than doing it through text.<br>
            A strong visual help teams understand and retain your message.<br>
            So the next time you want to engage your teams in an effort to drive customer-focused change, take the time to engage a graphic designer to ensure you’re effectively communicating your message. Your employees will thank you. And, once they act on the information, so will your customers.

            <p class="lead">Walking a Mile in Your Customer’s Shoes</p>
            <p>Customer journey maps can be useful beyond the UX design and marketing teams. They can help facilitate a common business understanding of how every customer should be treated across all sales, logistics, distribution, care, etc. channels. This in turn can help break down “organizational silos” and start a process of wider customer-focused communication in a business.</p>
            <p><strong>They may also be employed to educate stakeholders as to what customers perceive when they interact with the business. They help them explore what customers think, feel, see, hear and do and also raise some interesting “what ifs” and the possible answers to them.</strong></p>
            <p>A customer journey map is a very simple idea: a diagram that illustrates the steps your customer(s) go through in engaging with your company, whether it be a product, an online experience, retail experience, or a service, or any combination. The more touchpoints you have, the more complicated — but necessary — such a map becomes. Sometimes customer journey maps are “cradle to grave,” looking at the entire arc of engagement.</p>
        
            <p class="lead">What Do You Need to Do to Create a Customer Journey Map?</p>
            <p>Firstly, you will need to do some preparation prior to beginning your journey maps ideally you should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>user-personas</strong> - If you can’t tell a typical user’s story, how will you know if you’ve captured their journey?</li>
                <li><strong>a timescale</strong> - Customer journeys can take place in a week, a year, a lifetime, etc. and it’s useful to know what length of journey you will measure before you begin</li>
                <li><strong>a clear understanding of customer touchpoints</strong> - What is your customer doing and how are they doing it?</li>
                <li><strong>a clear understanding of the channels in which actions occur</strong> - Channels are the places where customers interact with the business – from Facebook pages to retail stores. This helps you understand what your customers are actually doing</li>
                <li><strong>an understanding of any other actors that might alter the customer experience</strong> - For example, friends, family, colleagues, etc. that may influence the way a customer feels about any given interaction</li>
                <li><strong>a plan for “moments of truth”</strong> – the positive interactions that create good feelings in customers that can be used at touchpoints where frustrations exist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you’ve done your preparation you can follow a simple 8 point process to develop your customer journey maps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>review organization objectives</strong> – what are your goals for this mapping exercise? What organizational needs do you intend to meet?</li>
                <li><strong>review current research</strong> – the more user research you have at your fingertips, the easier this exercise will be. Be creative and if you don’t have the right research to define the journey – consider how you can carry that research out</li>
                <li><strong>review touchpoints and channels</strong> – the next step is to ensure that touchpoints and channels are effectively mapped. So for example a touchpoint could be “pay this invoice” and channels could be “online”, “retail”, “over the phone”, “mail”, etc. It can also help to brainstorm at this stage and see if there are any touchpoints or channels you’ve missed in your original data collection exercise</li>
                <li><strong>create an empathy map</strong> - An empathy map examines how the customer feels during each interaction – you want to concentrate on how the customer feels and thinks as well as what they will say, do, hear, etc. in any given situation</li>
                <li><strong>build an affinity diagram</strong> - The idea here is to first brainstorm around each concept you’ve touched on and then to create a diagram which relates all these concepts, feelings, etc. together. This is best achieved by grouping ideas in categories and labeling them. You can eliminate concepts, etc. which don’t seem to have any impact on customer experience at this stage too</li>
                <li><strong>sketch the customer journey</strong> - How you do this is up to you; you can build a nice timeline map that brings together the journey over the course of time. You could also turn the idea into a video or an audio clip or use a completely different style of diagram. The idea is simply to show the motion of a customer through touchpoints and channels across your time period and how they feel about each interaction on that journey</li>
                <li><strong>iterate and produce</strong> - Then take your sketches and make them into something useful, keep refining the content and then produce something that is visually appealing and useful to stakeholders, team members, etc. Don’t be afraid to rope in a graphic designer at this stage if you’re not good at making things look awesome</li>
                <li><strong>distribute and utilise</strong> - The journey maps is no use sat on your hard drive or in your desk drawer – you need to get it out there to people and explain why it’s important. Then it needs to be put to use, you should be able to define KPIs around the ideal journey, for example, and then measure future success as you improve the journey</li>

        <a name="userstory"></a>
        <h3>User stories = As a , I want to, so that</h3>
        <p>User stories are a simple tool for articulating the user’s perspective. They are not long, wordy stories to be told around a camp fire but rather short (often only a single sentence) descriptions of what a user will do with a part of a system. They are written in plain English or in the language of the business in which they will be used and require no special literary gifts or linguistic talents to compose.</p>
        <p>They are particularly important in Agile environments where they facilitate the functionality of a system but can be used in any environment to ensure that design and development are focused on user needs. They deliver the “who”, “what” and “why” of user requirements in a format that can be easily understood by anyone who needs to use them.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits of Using User Stories in Design and Development</strong><br>
                There are several benefits of using user stories in design and development cycles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>simple and quick to understand</li>
            <li>allow programmers to quickly (using agile) implement customer/user value</li>
            <li>don’t need very much maintenance</li>
            <li>can be discounted except when they are being used in development</li>
            <li>allow a project to be chunked into smaller milestones</li>
            <li>make it easier to estimate costs on a project for development</li>
            <li>facilitate cooperative working with clients and users</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Drawbacks of Using User Stories in Design and Development</strong><br>
            There are possible drawbacks of using user stories and in particular of becoming overly-reliant on them at the expense of other tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>difficult to work into large scale projects (where thousands of stories might be required)</li>
            <li>may be too vague to be useful and require a lot of back and forth between developers and clients</li>
            <li>fail to capture performance measurements and sometimes non-functional aspects of the system – e.g. they are too simple</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to use which user research method</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>20 UX methods in brief</strong></a></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usability-Lab Studies:</strong> participants are brought into a lab, one-on-one with a researcher, and given a set of scenarios that lead to tasks and usage of specific interest within a product or service.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethnographic Field Studies:</strong> researchers meet with and study participants in their natural environment, where they would most likely encounter the product or service in question.</li>
            <li><strong>Participatory Design:</strong> participants are given design elements or creative materials in order to construct their ideal experience in a concrete way that expresses what matters to them most and why.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://medium.com/mule-design/focus-groups-are-worthless-7d30891e58f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Focus Groups</a>:</strong> groups of 3–12 participants are lead through a discussion about a set of topics, giving verbal and written feedback through discussion and exercises.</li>
            <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> a researcher meets with participants one-on-one to discuss in depth what the participant thinks about the topic in question.</li>
            <li><strong>Eyetracking:</strong> an eyetracking device is configured to precisely measure where participants look as they perform tasks or interact naturally with websites, applications, physical products, or environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Usability Benchmarking:</strong> tightly scripted usability studies are performed with several participants, using precise and predetermined measures of performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderated Remote Usability Studies:</strong> usability studies conducted remotely with the use of tools such as screen-sharing software and remote control capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Unmoderated Remote Panel Studies:</strong> a panel of trained participants who have video recording and data collection software installed on their own personal devices uses a website or product while thinking aloud, having their experience recorded for immediate playback and analysis by the researcher or company.</li>
            <li><strong>Concept Testing:</strong> a researcher shares an approximation of a product or service that captures the key essence (the value proposition) of a new concept or product in order to determine if it meets the needs of the target audience; it can be done one-on-one or with larger numbers of participants, and either in person or online.</li>
            <li><strong>Diary/Camera Studies:</strong> participants are given a mechanism (diary or camera) to record and describe aspects of their lives that are relevant to a product or service, or simply core to the target audience; diary studies are typically longitudinal and can only be done for data that is easily recorded by participants.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Feedback:</strong> open-ended and/or close-ended information provided by a self-selected sample of users, often through a feedback link, button, form, or email.</li>
            <li><strong>Desirability Studies:</strong> participants are offered different visual-design alternatives and are expected to associate each alternative with a set of  attributes selected from a closed list; these studies can be both qualitative and quantitative.</li>
            <li><strong>Card Sorting:</strong> a quantitative or qualitative method that asks users to organize items into groups and assign categories to each group. This method helps create or refine the information architecture of a site by exposing users’ mental models.</li>
            <li><strong>Clickstream Analysis:</strong> analyzing the record of screens or pages that users clicks on and sees, as they use a site or software product; it requires the site to be instrumented properly or the application to have telemetry data collection enabled.</li>
            <li><strong>A/B Testing (also known as “multivariate testing,” “live testing,” or “bucket testing”):</strong> a method of scientifically testing different designs on a site by randomly assigning groups of users to interact with each of the different designs and measuring the effect of these assignments on user behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Unmoderated UX Studies:</strong> a quantitative or qualitative and automated method that uses a specialized research tool to captures participant behaviors (through software installed on participant computers/browsers) and attitudes (through embedded survey questions), usually by giving participants goals or scenarios to accomplish with a site or prototype.</li>
            <li><strong>True-Intent Studies:</strong> a method that asks random site visitors what their goal or intention is upon entering the site, measures their subsequent behavior, and asks whether they were successful in achieving their goal upon exiting the site.</li>
            <li><strong>Intercept Surveys:</strong> a survey that is triggered during the use of a site or application.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Surveys:</strong> a survey in which participants are recruited from an email message.</li>
        </ul>
