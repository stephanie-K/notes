            <p><strong>When to do User Research</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>user research fits into the development process on all stages, depending on why you want to do user research</li>
                <li>when and what type depends on what work process looks like</li>
                <li>if UCD process, then UR is an integrated part of the process</li>
                <li>if not UCD than it's up to you to be smart about when and how to research</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Rules of thumb</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>the sooner the better (ideally start before development)</li>
                <li>do the user research you can where you are</li>
                <li>be proactive rather than reactive</li>
                <li>prioritise your efforts</li>
                <li>be open to changing the end goal</li>
                <li>be prepared to go small but not too small</li>
                <li>only do user research if it can have an impact</li>     
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Involve Stakeholders in Your User Research</strong><br>
                When you plan a user research project, involving your stakeholders is vital. They can provide you with information about the project and ensure that you don’t do irrelevant work or waste time doing a duplicate study. Talking to stakeholders also gives you an opportunity to engage them in your project. In small companies, knowing whom to talk to and what to ask is straightforward; however, in bigger projects, you have to consider different types of stakeholders. The best way to involve stakeholders is often to do informal interviews asking what they know about the project, how they are involved in the project, what the history of the project is, and how users/customers have already been involved. With stakeholders fully on board with your project, you can go practically anywhere and navigate around obstacles that would otherwise block your progress.

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Get comfortable being uncomfortable</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Ask first, prototype later</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Know your goal</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Agree on the big questions</strong></li>
                <li><strong>There is always enough time and money</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Don’t expect data to change minds:</strong><br>
                    The whole point of gathering evidence is to make evidence-based decisions. If that evidence undermines or contradicts the ideas of beliefs of the person with authority to make decisions, they will find reasons to reject it or ignore it. This is also at the heart of why qualitative researchers have a hard time in some engineering-driven organizations. People who are comfortable and competent with numbers want answers in numbers, even if the question demands something more descriptive.<br>
                    So you have to turn ethnography inward and learn how your peers and leaders make decisions before you try to use data to influence those decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace messy imperfection</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Commit to collaboration: </strong><br>
                    Research without collaboration means that one group of people is learning and creating reports for another group to acknowledge and ignore. Knowledge leaks out of even the most well-meaning teams working like this. Collaboration without evidence means everyone has tacitly agreed whose personal preferences win. Neither of these is the most productive approach.<br>
                    Directly involving the people creating the product in asking and answering the questions is the most productive approach. Plus it’s fun. </li>
                <li><strong>Find your bias buddies</strong></li>
            </ol>

        <h3>5 Whys</h3>
        <p>Quite literally, asking your users “Why?” whenever they explain their behaviours to you. Each time you ask “Why?”, you will prompt someone to re-evaluate their position in order to dig a little deeper into their own reasoning. It may seem a little odd to keep asking “Why?” at first, but it will bring great insights while allowing you to dig deeper in order to find the root cause(s) of their behaviours.</p>

        <p>In UX, the method is used to organise research findings or to sort design ideas in ideation workshops, it should be quick and collaborative.</p>
        <p>2 steps</p>
        <ul>
            <li>generating sticky notes (during ideations workshop or usability testing session)</li>
            <li>organising them in groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We need to keep moving, it can be long, needs to be facilitated, encourage participant, set priorities.<br>
            Need a big wall, all notes on it no specific order<br>
            Create categories names, either before or if they emerge
        </p>
        <p>The general steps we’ll follow are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sort into top-level categories</li>
            <li>sort each of those categories into subcategories</li>
            <li>summarize those categories</li>
            <li>determine priorities (e.g., by taking votes)</li>
            <li>plan subsequent design meetings as needed</li>
            <li>no talking as you sort, please. It gets distracting and makes the process take longer. This meeting should take not more than 3 (usually 2) hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Look for a category which makes sense, if none, create one and tell the others<br>
            Yell the new category name<br>
            If note is not clear, put in the ? category<br>
            If similar notes, stack them, most descriptive on top.
        </p>
        <p>Then divide categories in subcategories, on or two person per category<br>
            Present the category you sorted<br>
            Find the priorities (either use a scale, or people put points on them, each get 3 - <a href="index.html#dot"><span class="red">Dot voting</span></a>) <br>
            Or 100$. value different ideas, total of price of ideas will be $100 <br>
            Or NUF: New Useful and Feasible: 1 to 7 for each attribute, then total and the idea with higher total has the priority. (newer is better)
        </p>
        <p>Write main point on a flipchart, take photos of the walls<br>
            Assign follow up task<br>
            Announce a written report about this<br>
            Announce next design workshop meeting will be scheduled
        </p>
        <p>Time will depend on nb of post its, number of attendee and if they are new to the concept or not. <strong>Max 3 hours!</strong></p>

        <p>UX workshops have <strong>numerous benefits</strong>: educate people and make them empathic towards users, make stakeholders feel involved and responsible for ideas and research findings, create awareness of usability issues and design challenges, build common ground across all parties involved, and bring together many types of backgrounds and expertise.</p>
        <p>However, in such UX workshops, it <strong>can be challenging</strong> to engaging the team, and creating order among diverse ideas and facts.</p>
        <p>I used to think that, as a user researcher, my job was to make the information I collected about users as understandable and digestible as possible for my team. And as a designer, I was supposed to come up with the best design solution. While I still feel these things are true, I have learned that <strong>insulating stakeholders from all the false starts, design ideas, details and messy notes taken in tests does them a disservice</strong>. To educate other team members, involve them in design, <strong>build consensus, and increase sensitivity to usability issues</strong>, get them involved in taking notes, sorting them, and discussing them rather that protecting them from these processes.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cognitive biases are shortcuts the brain takes to make decisions. 95% of cognition is subconscious. Next time someone asks you why you're doing something, the most honest answer you can give is "how the hell should I know?"</li>
            <li>Cognitive fluency is a thing. Clarity is king in product content strategy: Easy to read = easy to do, Hard to read = hard to do </li>
            <li>Our own biases can be the biggest danger to users. Watch out for déformation professionnelle, the tendency to view the world through the eyes of our own profession. And the bias blind spot – we all have cognitive biases</li>
            <li>The best way to recognise and overcome bias is to question our assumptions in a systematic way. And get really good at listening, because it's impossible to listen and react at the same time</li>

                <li><strong>Back-stage (Invisible Contact Employee) Actions:</strong> (The 'line of visibility' separates the front-stage and back-stage actions). Non-visible steps taken by contact employees behind the line of visibility. e.g. taking a hotel or restaurant reservation by telephone</li>
                <li><strong>Support Processes:</strong> Activities carried out by employees who are not contact employees, but whose actions are required for the service to be delivered</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Evidence:</strong> Tangible elements associated with each step that has the potential to influence customer perceptions of the service encounter e.g. uniforms, delivery vans</li>

        <p>When working in UX, one learns that users don’t read. They’ll skim content, jumping from headline to headline. They’ll dismiss modals and messages without reading them, and ignore the blindingly obvious in favour of the task they’re trying to achieve.<br>
        This implies that few users will read notices about the use of cookies on a website, let alone dive into lengthy legalese privacy and data use policies — if they even understand the implications of what they’re reading.
        </p>
        <p>If we choose to track user activity, users should be able to choose whether or not to participate. Informed consent should be a requirement for certain types of tracking for UX research.</p>

        <p>The cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method in which one or more evaluators work through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user.</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>may be done without first hand access to users</li>
            <li>unlike some usability inspection methods, takes explicit account of the user's task</li>
            <li>provides suggestions on how to improves learnability of the system</li>
            <li>can be applied during any phase of development</li>
            <li>is quick and inexpensive to apply if done in a streamlined form</li>
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>the value of the data is limited by the skills of the evaluators</li>
            <li>tends to yield a relatively superficial and narrow analysis that focuses on the words and graphics used on the screen</li>
            <li>the method does not provide an estimate on the frequency or severity of identified problems</li>
            <li>following the method exactly as outlined in the research is labor intensive</li>

        <p>Ethnographic research, such as user observation and interviews, will allow you to discover who your users really are, and the environments in which they live. It will provide great insights into the way that your users will interact with your product.<br>
            There are specific challenges associated with ethnographic research—the main one being that it’s not a quantitative process. You don’t end up with neat numbers, graphs, and figures. Instead, it’s a qualitative process, which involves producing a great deal of unruly data that is hard to summarize. It is also difficult, and some would say impossible, not to let your own biases or assumptions sneak into the research process.<br>
            It’s important to focus on and empathise with the people you design for, and truly listen to and understand them, rather than concentrating on your expected process outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>You need to be aware of potential sources of bias and take care to eliminate them. You will also need as <strong>diverse a team</strong> as possible in order to obtain the best insights.</p>
        <p>Take time to <strong>introduce yourself, explain what’s going to happen, and invite questions from the start</strong>. Try to illustrate through the process that what the person is saying/doing is important and of value to you.</p>
        <p>Rather than guessing or assuming the reasons behind people’s behaviour—you should <strong>ask the people to explain things for themselves.</strong> You should listen to the answer, figure out what is not being said, and observe their body language. It may be because of pride, or perhaps it’s because of trouble finding the right words. Sometimes, their answers can reveal sharp insights about the problems they are facing.</p>
        <p>Learn to video or photograph your ethnographic research. You can then go back and look at things such as body language and the <strong>environmental interactions that may govern a response</strong> as well as affect how they use your product or service.</p>
        <p>The <strong>easiest way to introduce bias into your research is to have a solution in mind.</strong> It will guide your questioning, observations, and understanding in the direction you want rather than the direction of your users, and you may not even realize it.</p>

        <p>Personas are facsimiles of your real customers — ones that fit in tidy, psychographic boxes. Each step that you take away from the harsh, messy reality of your customer is dangerous.</p>
        <p><strong>anti-persona</strong>: What are the qualities, beliefs, and demographics of someone who will never use your product? Temper your enthusiasm that “everyone” will use your product by soberly outlining the people who will never use it.</p>
        <p>Some times it's more useful to look at a user mindset instead of focussing on a user type. This is similar to 'job to be done' strategy.</p>
        <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/jobs-to-be-done-personas-5faa0ea3d438" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nikki Anderson: Jobs to be done personas</strong></a></p>
        <p><em>Jobs To Be Done encompasses the concept that users are trying to get something done, and that they “hire” certain products or services in order to make progress towards accomplishing goals. Usually, we all want to be better than we are in a given moment. We all have goals that lead us closer to our ideal self. So, we will look for, and purchase, certain products or services when our current reality does not match what we want for the future.</em></p>

        <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/creating-personas-from-user-research-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Creating Personas from User Research Results</strong></a></p>
        <p>Creating personas is a powerful way to make the user group come alive to your design team members and clients. Developing an engaging persona starts with user research. Then, you balance the data you collected with some fictitious information that evokes empathy. When developing a persona, you should strive for a good balance between research data and fictional details to ensure credibility and applicability. Also, the balance between short and to-the-point information, and more elaborate scenarios is important for overview and engagement.</p>
        <p>A good persona includes six main elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>name, age, gender, and an image or not... more and more advise against having a photo</li>
            <li>a tag line</li>
            <li>the experience and relevant skills</li>
            <li>some context to indicate the interaction</li>
            <li>any goals, attitudes, and concerns</li>
            <li>quotes or a brief scenario</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More tips for demographic-free persona building:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>no photos: Sophie Dennis has observed “One client used a photo of a young blonde-haired woman. That persona would get dismissed as ‘The Blonde.’”</li>
            <li>use gender-neutral names, or no names at all, and write bios in the first person</li>
            <li>phrase the thinking styles so that users would be happy to identify with them</li>
            <li>understand that one person can switch between multiple thinking styles depending on the circumstances</li>
        </ul>

            <li>We need to be thinking of not how we replicate what we did before, but what are the needs/outcomes we really want to achieve (do we really need to do a workshop for example?)</li>
            <li>Jonathan Nichols: @GDSTeam are releasing a blog on remote UR as well as list of remote UR tools v soon. @DhruvSharma101has created a google doc repository too, structured against use cases, rather than type of tools.</li>
            <li>We need to think now about knowledge management, more important now than ever. How do we em board people new to the organisation without a knowledge repository? - @lily_dart (also what happens if URers fall ill?)</li>
            <li>Ethics and safeguarding are both important. How do we go about doing safe research with children? We also need to do research with those that are digitally excluded, and we need to find a way to do that - @svmboyd</li>
            <li>There’s an interesting opportunity potentially to connect ourselves into the grassroots local networks who are engaging with those that are socially isolated. We also need to remember that we have phones and can do interviews over phone</li>
            <li>Should we continue doing research? Balance the risk of doing it against not doing it. Is this is going to burden participants or is the environment is going to affect the outcomes of research? We need to look at each case. May be opportunity to do internal user research (all)</li>
            <li>And last but definitely not the least, be kind, with ourselves, colleagues, and participants and be honest with participants about our constraints. It is really hard balancing work on childcare & we don't have all the answers yet - and all.</li>

        <p>This isn’t really about blind men and elephants. It’s about seeing the big picture in our research. The blind men offer us a useful metaphor for what we can’t see when we’re not looking for it.<br>
            That means as user researchers we want to try and use meaningful samples sizes in our research to get the opinion of enough “blind men” to be relevant. Then we need to ensure that our research offers enough balance so that we can determine what people say and what they do. We need both qualitative and quantitative data to provide real insight. We need to keep an eye on the picture in case it changes and that means developing a rhythm to our research so that it is constantly evolving that picture.<br>         
            We need to work with everyone involved with users to ensure that we are not “blind men” ourselves and finally we need to bring all the data generated together into one place so that we can develop that big picture and share it with others who need it. Only then can we see the elephant.

        <p>This is a cognitive mapping technique, the instruction was: ‘draw your digital life’, every one of them starting scribbling immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Extract the map:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>give interviewee a stack of blank paper and a black pen</li>
            <li>choose two more pens in contrasting colours dark enough to show up in a scan, and keep these to one side</li>
            <li>tell them: ‘You’ve got 6 minutes to draw [concept]. Just doodle whatever that means to you, you can’t get it wrong. Include anything you want: objects, people, shapes, scribbles, even a few words if you need to label something you’ve drawn. You’ll be using these three pens and you get two minutes with each pen. I’ll hand you a new pen when it’s time to switch. Ready? Go!’</li>
            <li>start a silent timer, shut up, and try to be inconspicuous</li>
            <li>after 2 minutes, and again after 4 minutes, gently take the pen they’re using and give them the next one</li>
            <li>tell them when they’ve got 20 seconds left.</li>
            <li>if they’re still scribbling at 6 minutes, give them a few more seconds to finish what they’re doing</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Use the map to navigate the interview</strong><br>
            Once the pens are capped, thank the interviewee for being up for it and ask them if they’d like to explain what they’ve drawn.
        </p>
        <p>As they talk, prompt for extra details when needed but don’t try to guide them at all. If they skip over part of the drawing then go back to it at the end with a simple “What’s this bit?” Don’t speculate - let everything be in their words.</p>
        <p><strong>Why 3 pens? And why 2 minutes per pen?</strong><br>
            This helps us understand the participant’s priorities and thought processes.
        </p>
        <p>Whatever came into their head first is likely to be the most central, fundamental thing they associate with the concept. We can see what that is because it’s drawn in black.</p>
        <p>If they had any last minute flurries of inspiration on hearing there were only 20 seconds left, these will be drawn in the third colour.</p>
        <p>And the ways the 3 colours overlap — or don’t — hints at how they went about breaking the concept down in their head. Once we know whether they were thinking chronologically, in categories, or simply scattergunning, we can tailor our questions appropriately.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/storymap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Story Mapping</strong></a></p>
        <p>Story mapping consists of ordering user stories along two independent dimensions. The "map" arranges user activities along the horizontal axis in rough order of priority (or "the order in which you would describe activities to explain the behaviour of the system"). Down the vertical axis, it represents increasing sophistication of the implementation.<br>
            <strong>Given a story map so arranged, the first horizontal row represents a "walking skeleton", a barebones but usable version of the product. Working through successive rows fleshes out the product with additional functionality.</strong>   
        </p>
        <p>One intent of this practice is to avoid a failure mode of incremental delivery, where a product could be released composed of features that in principle are of high business value but are unusable because they are functionally dependent on features which are of lower value and were therefore deferred to future releases.</p>

        <p>All the interactions a customer will have with an organisation throughout their customer lifecycle.<br>
            If you want your teams to remember what really matters to your customers – their <strong>Moments of Truth</strong>, their delights, and what frustrates them – then communicating this pictorially is far more effective than doing it through text.<br>
            A strong visual help teams understand and retain your message.<br>
            So the next time you want to engage your teams in an effort to drive customer-focused change, take the time to engage a graphic designer to ensure you’re effectively communicating your message. Your employees will thank you. And, once they act on the information, so will your customers.

            <p class="lead">Walking a Mile in Your Customer’s Shoes</p>
            <p>Customer journey maps can be useful beyond the UX design and marketing teams. They can help facilitate a common business understanding of how every customer should be treated across all sales, logistics, distribution, care, etc. channels. This in turn can help break down “organizational silos” and start a process of wider customer-focused communication in a business.</p>
            <p><strong>They may also be employed to educate stakeholders as to what customers perceive when they interact with the business. They help them explore what customers think, feel, see, hear and do and also raise some interesting “what ifs” and the possible answers to them.</strong></p>
            <p>A customer journey map is a very simple idea: a diagram that illustrates the steps your customer(s) go through in engaging with your company, whether it be a product, an online experience, retail experience, or a service, or any combination. The more touchpoints you have, the more complicated — but necessary — such a map becomes. Sometimes customer journey maps are “cradle to grave,” looking at the entire arc of engagement.</p>
        
            <p class="lead">What Do You Need to Do to Create a Customer Journey Map?</p>
            <p>Firstly, you will need to do some preparation prior to beginning your journey maps ideally you should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>user-personas</strong> - If you can’t tell a typical user’s story, how will you know if you’ve captured their journey?</li>
                <li><strong>a timescale</strong> - Customer journeys can take place in a week, a year, a lifetime, etc. and it’s useful to know what length of journey you will measure before you begin</li>
                <li><strong>a clear understanding of customer touchpoints</strong> - What is your customer doing and how are they doing it?</li>
                <li><strong>a clear understanding of the channels in which actions occur</strong> - Channels are the places where customers interact with the business – from Facebook pages to retail stores. This helps you understand what your customers are actually doing</li>
                <li><strong>an understanding of any other actors that might alter the customer experience</strong> - For example, friends, family, colleagues, etc. that may influence the way a customer feels about any given interaction</li>
                <li><strong>a plan for “moments of truth”</strong> – the positive interactions that create good feelings in customers that can be used at touchpoints where frustrations exist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you’ve done your preparation you can follow a simple 8 point process to develop your customer journey maps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>review organization objectives</strong> – what are your goals for this mapping exercise? What organizational needs do you intend to meet?</li>
                <li><strong>review current research</strong> – the more user research you have at your fingertips, the easier this exercise will be. Be creative and if you don’t have the right research to define the journey – consider how you can carry that research out</li>
                <li><strong>review touchpoints and channels</strong> – the next step is to ensure that touchpoints and channels are effectively mapped. So for example a touchpoint could be “pay this invoice” and channels could be “online”, “retail”, “over the phone”, “mail”, etc. It can also help to brainstorm at this stage and see if there are any touchpoints or channels you’ve missed in your original data collection exercise</li>
                <li><strong>create an empathy map</strong> - An empathy map examines how the customer feels during each interaction – you want to concentrate on how the customer feels and thinks as well as what they will say, do, hear, etc. in any given situation</li>
                <li><strong>build an affinity diagram</strong> - The idea here is to first brainstorm around each concept you’ve touched on and then to create a diagram which relates all these concepts, feelings, etc. together. This is best achieved by grouping ideas in categories and labeling them. You can eliminate concepts, etc. which don’t seem to have any impact on customer experience at this stage too</li>
                <li><strong>sketch the customer journey</strong> - How you do this is up to you; you can build a nice timeline map that brings together the journey over the course of time. You could also turn the idea into a video or an audio clip or use a completely different style of diagram. The idea is simply to show the motion of a customer through touchpoints and channels across your time period and how they feel about each interaction on that journey</li>
                <li><strong>iterate and produce</strong> - Then take your sketches and make them into something useful, keep refining the content and then produce something that is visually appealing and useful to stakeholders, team members, etc. Don’t be afraid to rope in a graphic designer at this stage if you’re not good at making things look awesome</li>
                <li><strong>distribute and utilise</strong> - The journey maps is no use sat on your hard drive or in your desk drawer – you need to get it out there to people and explain why it’s important. Then it needs to be put to use, you should be able to define KPIs around the ideal journey, for example, and then measure future success as you improve the journey</li>

        <p><a href="https://medium.com/@AltexSoft/acceptance-criteria-purposes-formats-and-best-practices-d5fe25e1cd19" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Acceptance Criteria: Purposes, Formats, and Best Practices</strong></a></p>
        <p>User stories are a simple tool for articulating the user’s perspective. They are not long, wordy stories to be told around a camp fire but rather short (often only a single sentence) descriptions of what a user will do with a part of a system. They are written in plain English or in the language of the business in which they will be used and require no special literary gifts or linguistic talents to compose.</p>
        <p>They are particularly important in Agile environments where they facilitate the functionality of a system but can be used in any environment to ensure that design and development are focused on user needs. They deliver the “who”, “what” and “why” of user requirements in a format that can be easily understood by anyone who needs to use them.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits of Using User Stories in Design and Development</strong><br>
                There are several benefits of using user stories in design and development cycles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>simple and quick to understand</li>
            <li>allow programmers to quickly (using agile) implement customer/user value</li>
            <li>don’t need very much maintenance</li>
            <li>can be discounted except when they are being used in development</li>
            <li>allow a project to be chunked into smaller milestones</li>
            <li>make it easier to estimate costs on a project for development</li>
            <li>facilitate cooperative working with clients and users</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Drawbacks of Using User Stories in Design and Development</strong><br>
            There are possible drawbacks of using user stories and in particular of becoming overly-reliant on them at the expense of other tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>difficult to work into large scale projects (where thousands of stories might be required)</li>
            <li>may be too vague to be useful and require a lot of back and forth between developers and clients</li>
            <li>fail to capture performance measurements and sometimes non-functional aspects of the system – e.g. they are too simple</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Are you in a safe place? (applies to phone interviews)</li>
            <li>If we talk about something that triggers you, is there someone you can call/talk to? </li>
            <li>DO NOT go into the interview with a list of scripted questions, as if the person is a data point. Let them lead.</li>
            <li>Don't insist when they don't respond coherently to a question</li>
            <li>NEVER interrupt. Not even to clarify. Listen, wait for a pause, then ask follow-up questions. "Hey, is it ok if I ask you more about TK</li>
            <li>Check-in: "Are you doing ok? Do you need a break?" This is esp. important in phone interviews, as it's harder to pick up on social cues</li>
            <li>If, once you've shared the purpose of the interview & gone through informed consent, someone decides they want to speak with you on background/anonymously, respect that. Never pressure or act disappointed.</li>
            <li>Don't say "I understand," and refer back to yourself or an experience you had, as if you're trying to relate. DO NOT DO THIS. </li>
            <li>Maybe the person decides the interview is too much and they want to end it abruptly (I did this), check-in with them after & see if they're ok.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usability-Lab Studies:</strong> participants are brought into a lab, one-on-one with a researcher, and given a set of scenarios that lead to tasks and usage of specific interest within a product or service.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethnographic Field Studies:</strong> researchers meet with and study participants in their natural environment, where they would most likely encounter the product or service in question.</li>
            <li><strong>Participatory Design:</strong> participants are given design elements or creative materials in order to construct their ideal experience in a concrete way that expresses what matters to them most and why.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://medium.com/mule-design/focus-groups-are-worthless-7d30891e58f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Focus Groups</a>:</strong> groups of 3–12 participants are lead through a discussion about a set of topics, giving verbal and written feedback through discussion and exercises.</li>
            <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> a researcher meets with participants one-on-one to discuss in depth what the participant thinks about the topic in question.</li>
            <li><strong>Eyetracking:</strong> an eyetracking device is configured to precisely measure where participants look as they perform tasks or interact naturally with websites, applications, physical products, or environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Usability Benchmarking:</strong> tightly scripted usability studies are performed with several participants, using precise and predetermined measures of performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderated Remote Usability Studies:</strong> usability studies conducted remotely with the use of tools such as screen-sharing software and remote control capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Unmoderated Remote Panel Studies:</strong> a panel of trained participants who have video recording and data collection software installed on their own personal devices uses a website or product while thinking aloud, having their experience recorded for immediate playback and analysis by the researcher or company.</li>
            <li><strong>Concept Testing:</strong> a researcher shares an approximation of a product or service that captures the key essence (the value proposition) of a new concept or product in order to determine if it meets the needs of the target audience; it can be done one-on-one or with larger numbers of participants, and either in person or online.</li>
            <li><strong>Diary/Camera Studies:</strong> participants are given a mechanism (diary or camera) to record and describe aspects of their lives that are relevant to a product or service, or simply core to the target audience; diary studies are typically longitudinal and can only be done for data that is easily recorded by participants.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Feedback:</strong> open-ended and/or close-ended information provided by a self-selected sample of users, often through a feedback link, button, form, or email.</li>
            <li><strong>Desirability Studies:</strong> participants are offered different visual-design alternatives and are expected to associate each alternative with a set of  attributes selected from a closed list; these studies can be both qualitative and quantitative.</li>
            <li><strong>Card Sorting:</strong> a quantitative or qualitative method that asks users to organize items into groups and assign categories to each group. This method helps create or refine the information architecture of a site by exposing users’ mental models.</li>
            <li><strong>Clickstream Analysis:</strong> analyzing the record of screens or pages that users clicks on and sees, as they use a site or software product; it requires the site to be instrumented properly or the application to have telemetry data collection enabled.</li>
            <li><strong>A/B Testing (also known as “multivariate testing,” “live testing,” or “bucket testing”):</strong> a method of scientifically testing different designs on a site by randomly assigning groups of users to interact with each of the different designs and measuring the effect of these assignments on user behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Unmoderated UX Studies:</strong> a quantitative or qualitative and automated method that uses a specialized research tool to captures participant behaviors (through software installed on participant computers/browsers) and attitudes (through embedded survey questions), usually by giving participants goals or scenarios to accomplish with a site or prototype.</li>
            <li><strong>True-Intent Studies:</strong> a method that asks random site visitors what their goal or intention is upon entering the site, measures their subsequent behavior, and asks whether they were successful in achieving their goal upon exiting the site.</li>
            <li><strong>Intercept Surveys:</strong> a survey that is triggered during the use of a site or application.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Surveys:</strong> a survey in which participants are recruited from an email message.</li>
