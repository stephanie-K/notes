                <p>Service Design is a user-centred approach to designing and creating all of the products and services a person needs to "solve a whole problem"</p>
                <p>Service Design aims to create an integrated consistent, positive experience across an enitre user journey across channels and over time</p>
                <p>Part of it will be a content strategy to make sure the content delivered is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>in the right place</li>
                    <li>at the right time</li>
                    <li>to the right user</li>
                    <li>distributed across the right channels</li>
                    <li>using consistent language</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>= Give uses the information they need when they need it</strong></p>
                <p><strong>In the front-stage, we design products and services for meaningful customer experiences. In the back-stage, we design processes, rituals and training to create outstanding employee engagement, cultural change and optimised tools.</strong></p>

                <p class="lead"><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/9-principles-of-service-design-3486a097b10e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>9 Principles of Service Design (Nielsen Norman)</strong></a></p>
                <p>According to Nielsen Norman, service design is: The activity of planning and organizing a business’s resources (people, props, and processes) in order to (1) directly improve the employee’s experience, and (2) indirectly, the customer’s experience.</p>
                <p>An interface is not a service. A product is not a service. A service is not a physical object and cannot be possessed.</p>
                <p>9 basic categories or ways in which organizations can improve service design.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NOT placing the business needs before the user’s needs</li>
                    <li>NOT making it hard to achieve the goal</li>
                    <li>personalising the service</li>
                    <li>before you even knew you needed it</li>
                    <li>the follow-up</li>
                    <li>mitigating the wait</li>
                    <li>Peak-end Rule (in memory, we remember the peak and ending of an experience in greater detail)</li>
                    <li>the runaround (being passed from one person/thing to the next)</li>
                    <li>duplicate efforts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short, the user experience is an entire ecosystem extending far beyond the boundaries of an interface or product. Service is part of that ecosystem. And to adequately address service design, we must map the experience to identify systemic failures along with organizational policies resulting in a poor experience for the user.</p>
                <p class="lead"><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/service-design-and-ux-design-whats-the-difference-508c41c65217" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Service Design and UX Design - what's the difference</strong></a></p>
                <p>Service designers aim to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>understand thoroughly the service proposition of the organisation or company in question</li>
                    <li>discern the needs of all the stakeholders and actors in a service — both customers and service providers</li>
                    <li>map out the service through a service ecology, service blueprint, and user journeys</li>
                    <li>co-create possible solutions or improvements by collaborating with service stakeholders</li>
                    <li>prototype and pilot new service experiences with real customers and staff</li>
                    <li>zoom in and out constantly between the details of individual touchpoints and the design of the overall service</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Service design starts by looking to make improvement in people, processes, assets and culture. That then indirectly goes on to influence the customer experience.</p>

                    <p>We need to understand users, their contexts, needs, and capabilities, and build the service around this.<br>
                        When redesigning a service, we need to simplify, reduce the complexity. number of steps, humanise language and reinterpret policy.</p>
                    <p>A service is a thing to help users, citizens or civil servants achieve a goal.<br>
                        The context in which they find out about and then do the thing is important.<br>
                    It always starts with a need and an idea of the outcome but not a clear idea of how it will be achieved.</p>

                    This is a visual, which will help us understand better the different parts of the service and who we need to involve in the design/discussion. 
                    The value is more in doing the map than the resulting map as it will highlight gaps we might have, but the finished map can still be useful for people who wants to understand the service.  
                    When we discuss future changes to the service, it will help us see who will be affected by our suggested changes

                    It's a bit like a user journey map but we are not referring to the user but the service itself for this journey.  
                    We will map across various service stages with rows/swims lanes for</p>

                    <p>This is a support for discussion with various actors, to help us understand what people are doing, when and with who, and help us identify gaps in our knowledge. 
                    This will prepare the work for a service blueprint later

                    It’s a tool we use to identify and map all the existing advice, guidance, transactional services and support that the public sector delivers in a defined service area. 
                    We are mapping how our service fits in the wider landscape of other services in the public sector. It will be high level and contributing to the ecosystem work too. 
                    This will help our understanding and highlight where collaboration need to happen with other teams once we start changing the service.

        <p>"Is what I’m designing consistent with other things we’ve designed (or others have designed)?” is the wrong question to ask.<br>
                Instead, the right question is, “Will the user’s current knowledge help them understand how to use what I’m designing?” Current knowledge is the knowledge the user has when they approach the design. It’s the sum of all their previous experiences with relevant products and designs.</p>

        <p>The reality is that a lot of Service Design is about understanding the status quo and fixing all the little things… the bits that fall between the gaps of different departments, get lost between different systems, and get missed between different touchpoints of the service, or get forgotten as your call is passed from one person to another.</p>
        <p>In the first week of September last year (2019) more than 100,000 people applied to register to vote in the UK general election. A feat achieved through the registration service designed by GDS. It’s really important to understand that this is not a “voting website” — it is a fully designed service from front to back end, from the click of the mouse to the printing and shipping of the voting card. It’s a service, with multiple teams and systems involved, and many touchpoints.</p>
    
        <p>4 lenses of service design</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7092024657289048064/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Thread by Sophie Dennis on LinkedIn</a></p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/sd/4-lenses-of-SD.jpeg"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/sd/4-lenses-of-SD.jpeg"/></a></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Viability</strong> - The Business Perspective<br>
            Service Design starts with understanding the business's objectives and ensuring that the proposed solutions are economically sustainable. It involves asking vital questions around business models, revenue streams, cost structures, and long-term profitability, amongst others</li>
            <li><strong>Feasibility</strong> - The Operational / Tech Perspective<br>
            Even the most promising concepts can fall short if they are not practically achievable. The feasibility lens allows us to assess the technical capabilities, operational resources, and constraints within the organisation. It is about bridging the gap between ideas and execution, paving the way for seamless implementation and operational excellence</li>
            <li><strong>Desirability</strong> - The Consumer, Customer, and User Perspective<br>
            At the heart of any successful service lies its appeal to the end-users. Understanding their needs, preferences, pain points, and desires is key to creating services that truly resonate. It is about building relationships and lasting connections</li>
            <li><strong>Responsibility</strong> - The Integrity Perspective<br>
            It is our duty to consider the broader impact of our solutions on society, the environment, and all stakeholders involved. By adopting regenerative and socially responsible practices, positively contributing to the communities we serve, we can foster a sense of purpose and trust in the brands we work with and stand the test of time</li>

    <p>A badly design login dialog box is the most:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>common dialog box in the world</li>
    <li>expensive (cost in password reset)</li>
    <li>complicated (password rules (from creating them to renewing them)</li>
    </ul> </p>
    
    <p>Creating the account is often the first thing users do with our design<br>
    Logging in is the first action of each session</p>
    
    <p>Security UX (SUX) is our users' first experience</p>
    
    <p>We need to protect the user and the system. Protecting:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>data</li>
        <li>personal information</li>
        <li>financial instruments</li>
        <li>access to other systems</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p>Angela Sasse - The compliance budget: how individual trade off the burden costs against the benefits to the organisation.<br>
     <em>"people have so much compliance to give and then they stop. I know keeping this secure is important but I need to get this job done in a timely fashion"</em><br>
    <strong>When poorly-designed SUX prevents people from doing their job, they work extra hard to by pass it.</strong></p>
    <p class="red"><strong>If it's not usable, it's not secure</strong></p>
    <p>Common security states:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>not logged in</li>
        <li>logged in</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p> Amazon has an extra one:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>identified & not logged In (from a cookie left on my machine)</li>
        <li><strong>one click</strong> unabled (even though I didn't put my password, I can make a purchase - no authorisation needed)</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p><strong>Identify:</strong> Who are you?<br>
    <strong>Authorise:</strong> do you have permission?<br>
    <strong>Authenticate:</strong> are you who you say you are?</p>

    <p><strong>Design is the rendering of intent</strong><br>
    We can thoughtfully split up: identification, authorisation and authentication to reduce the friction in our SUX experience.</p>

    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/sux1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/sux1.png"/></a>
        <a href="assets/images/ux/sux2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/sux2.png"/></a>
    </p>

    <p>Amazon created different threat models: How much security do we request at different points in the journey depending on the user's intent.</p>

    <p>In a car, the seat belt put the burden on the user vs an airbag which works only if you need it: it embeds the burden in the system.</p>

    <p>Safety is a burden. If you place it on the user, it creates frustration and is prone to accident.<br>
    If you place it on the system, it's more expensive and requires innovation.</p>
    
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/sux3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/sux3.png"/></a></p>

    <p>The designer's choice is:<br>
    Place the burden on our users or embed it into our systems?</p>

    <p><strong>Smart security perimeters postpone UX friction to the last possible moments.</strong></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/sux4.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/sux4.png"/></a></p>

    <p>The top reasons we continue to ignore SUX:<br>
    "This is what we've always done"<br>
    "This is how everyone else does it"</p>

   <p> Hacking a 15 characters password takes about 3 to 4 days in a brute force attack. But a phishing attack takes only 1 minutes, so having a strong password is not really a protection.</p>

    <p>Just assume passwords will never make your system secure.</p>

    <p>Two-factor authentication is better:
    <ul>
        <li>something you know (password)</li>
        <li>something you have (device, key)</li>
        <li>something you are (biometrics)</li>
    </ul></p>


    <p>As a user I want to log in ..... <strong>this is not a real user story</strong>, no one wants to log in in itself</p>

    <p>"UR shows users not reading the password rules on screen because they will use the password they usually use anyway and if it doesn't work they will swear"</p>

    <p>More and more users are using "password reset" as their password, <strong>"just send me a link!". It's the default option on Slack.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Satisficing</strong>: when user scan a page, they look at the available options but most of the time they chose the first reasonable option, not the best one.</p>
    <p><strong>We don't figure out how things work, we muddle through</strong>:<br>
        For most of us, it doesn't matter how things work, as long as we can use them. It's not for lack of intelligence but for lack of caring. In the great scheme of things, it's just non important to us.<br>
        If we find something that works, we stick to it. Once we find something that works no matter how badly, we tend not to look for a better way. We'll use a better way if we stumble across one, but we seldom look for one.<br>
        Muddling tends to be inefficient and error prone though.

    <p>If you want to design a website for kids, or are developing an app for them, here are a few key points to remember:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>instant feedback after every action confirms their effect</li>
        <li>don’t expect patience from them</li>
        <li>don’t rely on copy if possible</li>
        <li>small kids take everything literally</li>
        <li>trust doesn’t only mean giving consistent feedback but also that their parents can rely on our product for their kids’ safety</li>
        <li>use age groups, challenge them age-appropriately</li>
        <li>design for kids is still paid for by parents — always take them into consideration, too</li>

    <p>From David Caldwell, Head of Accessibility and Inclusion at the UK Home Office: "I came across a video by Eric Meyer, a bit of a legend in the world of web design. In his talk, ‘Designing for Crisis’, Eric talks about how he and his wife had to deal with a poorly designed hospital website in a moment of crisis.
        What this brought home to me was that accessibility isn’t about compliance with standards or just making things work for disabled people. It’s about designing and building products and services that work for real people in real
        situations, including when they’re in crisis or temporarily impaired."</p>

    <p>When something is obvious to us, it is extremely hard to know or remember what it was like without this knowledge. There is simply no way to unlearn what we know. If we extend the Curse of Knowledge to crafting user experiences, it teaches us an important lesson:<br>
        What we know vs. what we think our users know vs. what they really know are never the same.

    <p> A Design Language System is a set of rules or guidelines that heightens the level of harmony in a digital ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Now what is a digital ecosystem? It is nothing but interdependent group of enterprises, people or things that share a standardized digital platform for mutually beneficial purposes. To keep this ecosystem in harmony we need to understand the different groups involved, their requirements and expectations to build a wholesome design system that is scalable and efficient at the same time. This interdependent group of enterprises/people/things is where all of you (designers, developers) come in. All you should be doing is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get everyone ready and on the same page</li>
            <li>Collaborate at healthy intervals to curate a wholesome design language system</li>
            <li>Keep in mind the collective desire to provide good user experience while adding to internal efficiency</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The Design Language System is like setting a foundation for you to build on. It’ll make the build time shorter and much more efficient. </p>

    <p>What are Design Principles?<br>
        Design Principles are a set of guidelines that empower a team to make wise decisions and appropriate trade-offs when designing, building and innovating.</p>
    <p>Why use them?
        Applying design principles fosters a cohesive problem-solving approach, promoting efficiency, consistency and user-centricity.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Design principles are a set of values that act as a compass for your product. They’re an agreed upon truth: the guideposts that keep your entire team on the same path as you move through the design process. Design principles should be specific, nuanced, and actionable.</p>
    <p>Design principles are rules that will help guide you and your team while making important decisions throughout your projects. Whether they’re <strong>high-level and universal, or specific to your project/product</strong>, they have the power to unify all your collaborators around what is most important to you and your users. Here, we’ll look more into what design principles are, why you need them, and when and how to write them.</p>

    <h2>Do make me think</h2>
    <p><a href="https://medium.com/foolproof-ux/do-make-me-think-cacd25be0458" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>On Medium</strong></a></p>
    <p>Helping people make better decisions sometimes means designing complex interactions.<br>
        The world seems to think that the only outcome the customer is interested in is speed, but there are other outcomes we should be designing for: confidence; a sense of control; the suitability of a product or service that users need. Designers need to recognise that the flow needs moments of reflection and focus. Making the user stop and consider their decisions may add time, but — done well — it needn’t detract from a smooth sense of flow in an experience. Essential information points should not be so easily glossed over or missed, but highlighted and featured as important points of reference.
        </p>
    <p>There is a necessary complexity to many interactions, putting these processes online and on a phone changes the dynamic, but it doesn’t reduce the complexity, or the risk. They are complex by their very nature, requiring thought and consideration.</p>

    <h2>Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>A digital ecosystem is an interdependent group of enterprises, people and/or things that share standardised digital platforms for a mutually beneficial purpose, such as commercial gain, innovation or common interest. Digital ecosystems enable you to interact with customers, partners, adjacent industries ‒ and even your competition.</p>

    <p>Ways to influence the product owners</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>number 1 rule: respect</strong> - The thing with humans is, quite often, we think other people know what we know. Or everyone remembers the way we remember. It’s simply not the case. Sometimes, people genuinely come to daft conclusions because they don’t know something or they remember a meeting in an entirely different way to us. That’s because they have different baggage they bring with them. By remembering this, you start to get an idea that someone isn’t ‘blocking’ you; they are just in a different space with different information. To get your idea across really well, you need to bridge that gap between what you think you both know and what you actually know.</li>
        <li><strong>show, don't tell</strong> - When you are talking to someone about a new idea, have something to show. It can be bits of paper with line drawings on, little prototypes, someone else’s data that supports your idea – anything. When talking in the abstract, you are allowing people to fill in gaps in their head – they may not tell you what they are thinking but still say no. Have something tangible to look at, point at, and work out.</li>
        <li><strong>get out of the room</strong> - Use data and show that it's not your opinion but Research, studies showing something is not right. It's harder to fight research than fight your opinion or advice</li>
        <li><strong>use the silence</strong> - Often, if you are quiet, people just keep talking to fill the void. When they do that, they can, quite literally, talk themselves around. Don’t feel the need to speak in natural pauses. Let them do it. Sometimes, if you are bringing a new idea out of the blue, people need to think about it. Some people do that while talking. What I am saying is, give them a chance and stay  quiet. This is also the time when they tell you about all the stuff they thought you knew, or thought you didn’t need to know</li>

    <p><a href="https://adamsilver.io/articles/form-design-multiple-inputs-versus-one-input/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Adam Silver - Form design: multiple inputs versus one input</strong></a></p>
    <h4>Pillar #1: Don’t mess with labels</h4>
    <p> ​Every input needs a label. Sighted users can see them, visually-impaired users can hear them and motor-impaired users can more easily set focus to the related input.</p>
    <p>Put labels above the input. This works well with varying content, states, screen sizes and needs fewer eye fixations.</p>
    
    <p>Placeholders are problematic—both as makeshift labels and as a means of storing additional hint text. Instead put hint text below the label and above the input.</p>
    <p>​Float labels are also problematic. They have many of the same problems that placeholders have—and some of their own.</p>
    <p>Seriously, don’t mess with labels.</p>
    
    <h4>Pillar #2: Craft clear questions</h4>
    <p>​Only ask for information you definitely need. Use a question protocol to help you.</p>
    <p>​Avoid double-barrelled questions. They’re hard to understand.</p>
    <p>​Don’t mark required fields, mark optional ones. Or better yet avoid optional questions by using a branching question.</p>
    <p>Use hint text to tell users why you’re asking them for certain information—it’s not always obvious.</p>
    <p>Add hint text when users are more likely to make a mistake, like when having to satisfy a complex set of password rules. Error messages should be a last resort.</p>
    
    <h4>Pillar #3: Nail the style and microcopy</h4>
    <p>Make form fields look like form fields. Apply a border and make sure they start empty so it’s obvious where the input goes. Make fields easy to tap—44px height or more is good.</p>
    <p>The width of the field gives users a clue about the length of the content needed. So don’t make all fields the same width for aesthetic purposes when you know the expected length.</p>
    <p>Avoid multi column form layouts. They’re error prone, slower to use and can cause abandonment.</p>
    <p>Make buttons look like buttons. Align them to the left edge of the last input where users naturally look for them which also makes it easier for screen magnifier users.</p>
    <p>​Use sentence case for labels, hints and error messages. It’s easier to read and spot nouns. Use a verb for button text because the user is doing something.</p>
    
    <h4>Pillar #4: Help users fix errors quickly</h4>
    <p>Avoid default validation, don’t disable buttons and don’t validate as the user types.</p>
    <p>Validate the form when it’s submitted. And maybe enhance with JavaScript to do the same thing without a server-side round trip.</p>
    <p>Be tolerant of mistakes like extra spaces, dashes and slashes. Do the hard work so users don’t have to.</p>
    <p>Put errors in a list at the top of the page. When the user clicks on an error, set focus to the input. For a group of inputs, like radio buttons, set focus to the first input.</p>
    <p>Put the error message just above the field too. Placing it below is problematic.</p>
    <p>Prefix the word “Error -” to the document’s title. It’s the first thing announced by screen readers when the page loads.</p>
    <p>Style error messages in red and use a warning icon to provide a comparable experience for colour blind users.</p>
    <p>Error messages should be concise, specific, use plain language and avoid pleasantries like ‘please’.</p>
    
    <h4>Pillar #5: Hone the flow and order</h4>
    <p>Start with one thing per page. Then put the questions in a sensible order.
    <p>​Start without a progress indicator. They’re often unnecessary and can be tricky to design for dynamic flows.</p>
    <p>Tell users what they need and how long the form will take to complete before they start.</p>
    <p>In supersized forms, let users save their progress and return to finish it later. Break up the journey into small, manageable parts.</p>
    <p>Put back links in the top left of the page so users don’t have to scroll past the form to go back. Avoid putting links within the body of the form as it disrupts the tab sequence.</p>
    <p>Just before the end of the flow, let users check their answers and make changes. This provides reassurance and keeps users in control.</p>
    <p>After completion, show a confirmation page and send a confirmation email. Tell users what will happen next.</p>
    <p>Now’s the time to let your brand shine through. This is the beginning of the relationship—not the end.</p>
    
    <h4>Pillar #6: Master the micro interactions</h4>
    <p>Use the right input type. On mobile it will provide users with a more useful keyboard.</p>
    <p>Avoid the number input. It gives users a poor experience.</p>
    <p>Don’t mix up radio buttons and checkboxes. Remember you can have more than 7 options on a page.</p>
    <p>​Select boxes should be a last resort because they’re hard to use. Try radio buttons instead. Or use an autocomplete, if there’s a long list of options.</p>
    <p>Don’t use datalist for an autocomplete. It’s buggy and lacks support. Autocompletes are really tricky, so you can use mine.</p>
    <p>Use three separate text boxes for dates. Only use a date picker when users need to find a date in relation to another, or if they need to know the day, week or month that the date relates to. Date pickers are tricky. I share a good one in the Form Design Mastery 6 Week Challenge.</p>
    <p>Use a stepper component to help users make small numerical adjustments quickly and easily.</p>
    <p>​Don’t use multiple inputs when one will do, like when asking for a sort code. If you do have multiple inputs for a field, don’t auto tab between them. It causes users to make mistakes.</p>
    <p>File uploading: try to accept large files and as many file types as possible. Don’t rely on the multiple attribute. Besides a lack of support, it can only be used to select files from a single directory.</p>
    <p>Here’s one accessible way to let users upload multiple files.</p>
    
    <h4>Pillar #7: Optimise the rest</h4>
    <p>Design for common circumstances by putting the most used option first. Except when you need to avoid bias—like in surveys.</p>
    <p>Use the browser’s autofill routine to stop users from typing data manually. This also reduces the risk of typos.</p>
    <p>Avoid the maxlength attribute. Many users don’t look at the screen as they type, so they won’t notice that some of their keystrokes were ignored until they look up.</p>
    <p>Use form validation and a character count component instead.</p>
    <p>Use autocapitalize="none", autocorrect="off" and spellcheck="false" to stop browsers automatically changing user input on fields that expect grammatically incorrect data—like email addresses and passwords.</p>

    <h2>Gamification</h2>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/notes_gamification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My notes from the IDF course (19 pages)</a></p>
    <p><strong>Gamification is the art of adding game-like elements to experiences which traditionally do not involve fun or games.</strong> As it’s a young industry, it should be easier to get a “foot in the door” of gamification companies with demand for experienced designers far outstripping supply, and that means those businesses are going to be keen to take a chance on less-experienced but well-qualified designers.</p>
    <p>A review of the literature to date has shown a positive correlation that<strong> gamification does increase the effectiveness of the activity it is applied to</strong>. Of course, a lot depends on how gamification is used – a gamification can only work if the players find it motivating, interesting and fun. </p>
    <p><strong>The “Player-Centered Design” approach</strong> involves using the following five steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>know your player</li>
        <li>identify the mission</li>
        <li>understand human motivation</li>
        <li>apply mechanics</li>
        <li>manage, monitor and measure</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>The Four Basic Principles of Fun in a Game:</strong> Goals, Rules, Feedback, Voluntary Participation</p>
<a href="assets/images/ux/player-centered-Design.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/player-centered-Design.png"/></a>
    <p class="lead">A SMART mission</p>
    <p>It enables you to communicate to the gamification team not just what needs to be addressed through the project but also how you will be able to demonstrate success at the end of the project. The SMART goal-setting system is a remarkably effective tool that can help you define and fine-tune the real solution. It lets you remove all the obstacles that would otherwise lead to your arriving at false solutions.<br>
        If you understand what the situation is and what situation is required, it should be easy to build a SMART mission which promotes the success of your gamification exercise.<br>
        Gamification projects aren’t just about players; we also use them to achieve business results. Your gamification design team must research exactly what the business expects and ensure that everyone involved in the project focusses on these expectations throughout the design process. The idea is to create engagement with players that achieves results and return on investment. Getting the balance between fun engagement and serious results will pay off time and again for you as you progress to later gamification works in your career.

    <p>Ways to make an experience feel game-like and ways to fit lessons from games into web and app experiences — when the context allows, of course:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Document everything</strong></li>
        <p>In games, documentation can be used as a guiding force. Game design documentation can be short (1 page) or long (past 30 pages), but it always helps creators define game elements up front. Translating this to digital product design, this can be a document that outlines personas, user goals, and other information such as key statistics to track. This can help people who need information about current and upcoming projects to get going as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>If you decide to prioritize documentation, remember to write it as you go. It is more tedious to do everything at the end than to spend 15 minutes sharing updates every few days. There are lots of programs and apps you can use; InVision, Google Drive, and Basecamp are just a few. They all make it incredibly convenient to be a better communicator.</p>
        <li><strong>Simple isn’t always best</strong></li>
        <p>Complexity is important in games because it provides challenges for players to overcome. Game makers excel at ensuring the addition of complex features include usefulness and meaning. If every part of a game is complicated, players will quit. However, the right amount of roadblocks can make players feel accomplished when they are surpassed.</p>
        <p>Many apps are challenging to master, but worth the reward. This effort makes users feel like pros. For example, I am a loyal Sketch user because I know the ins and outs of the product. Finding new features and shortcuts gives me a sense of accomplishment. Consider ways to do the same in your product, especially if user goals require it to support a complex set of actions.</p>
        <li><strong>Connect through emotions and personality</strong></li>
        <p>Journey mapping is the process of mapping out how a user in a specific scenario feels during each step of a specific set of tasks. Journey mapping an existing set of features can help designers understand where improvements can be made, and journey mapping while creating user flows for new projects enables designers to avoid potential pitfalls.<br>
        In addition to emotions, people love personality. They want to identify with those behind the products they use and the games they play. In games, this is usually expressed through hidden secrets called easter eggs. Game designers use them to connect with players while rewarding them with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
        <li><strong>Give feedback</strong></li>
        <p>Responsiveness is important in games. It gives players the sense that their actions are contributing to changes shown on screen. In games, this feedback is known as “game feel” or “juice”. It is often expressed as screen shaking and changes in scale and color of objects.</p>
        <li><strong>Be intentional</strong></li>
        <p>Game elements shine when they are intentionally included. Users can tell when an experience is game-like as a gimmick. If you are considering the addition of game elements into your experiences, carefully think about their purpose.</p>

    <h2>Hick's Law: Making the choice easier for users</h2>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/hicks.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/hicks.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that <strong>the more stimuli (or choices) users face, the longer it will take them to make a decision.</strong> For designers of all types, this presents a challenge, making it imperative to offer the most useful set of options to avoid frustrating the user. This can be vital for safety. The U.S. Navy was quick to recognize the importance of the “Keep It Simple and Straightforward” (“K.I.S.S.”) principle, which reflects Hick’s Law.</p>
    <p>As web designers, we have an important choice to make before presenting users with the choices we hope they will select on our sites. We have to use Hick’s Law in conjunction with other design principles, especially on the landing page to make the most-desired option/s stand out.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, there’s no avoiding complexity, especially if we’re involved with presenting a huge amount of needed information about sophisticated products or intricate services. Using Hick’s Law can help us reduce that complexity by simplifying the decision-making process for our users.</p>
    <p>To make our designs work, we need to remember that a) the user’s time is precious, and b) a user is not obligated to stay on our site. To enhance the user experience, we should consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>categorizing Choice</strong> – Enabling users to find items from higher categories, as if they were looking under sections in a library.</li>
        <li><strong>obscuring Complexity</strong> – Breaking up long or complex processes into screens with fewer options.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once your website or app is live, you can use variables such as “time on site” and “page views” to understand if Hick’s law has been applied correctly.</p>
    <p>Overall, remember that Hick’s Law is a guideline you can adapt to your design. Always try to “flip” the perspective to see the choices you want to present from the outside. Avoid flooding with options, but bear in mind the balance between users’ time and comfort zones for handling options on a page. Guiding them to select between clear options that will get them somewhere quickly (such as a shopping cart) will take the work out of the user experience and reward you both.</p>
    <p>As a user experience designer, you have a great ally in the card-sorting method. Keep in mind that you:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>first need to find out who are your users and what they need</li>
        <li>then define the functionalities your product and service will offer to meet these needs</li>
        <li>use methods such as card sorting to build the right categorization and labels for these categories</li>  
    </ol>
    <p class="lead"> How to make choising easier - Sheena Lyengar</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the choice needs to mean something for the chooser, not for the choice maker</li>
        <li> choice overload reduces: engagement, decision quality and satisfaction</li>
        <li>you need to cut: less is more, concretise (make it real) and categorise (more categories, fewer choices)</li>

    <a name="ikea"></a>
    <h2>IKEA effect</h2>
    <p>The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that can influence the outcome and perceived value of products to a big degree. People tend to place high value on products they partially have created.<br>
        The more the needs for customization and co-production are present in your target audience the more the IKEA effect is relevant for you as a designer. The effect can help you instil feelings of competence in the user when the task is completed successfully.<br>
        The IKEA effect will create stronger bond between the user and the product. The effort that users will put into completing the product to a complete state will transform into love for that product. The subjective value will be higher in comparison to a product that hasn’t cost any effort.
        </p>
    <p>It is important to point out that <strong>the IKEA effect is not about putting the effort be it small or big, it is more about the completion of the task.</strong> The IKEA effect is present when <strong>the user can enjoy the completed task and the product.</strong> If the product is disassembled soon after the assembling the effect is lost.</p>
    <p><strong>Sometimes saving the users a bit of labour could deprive them from a bit more happiness if they were to make the small effort.</strong> Think if you should decrease the user effort to zero or close to zero.</p>
    <p>To make use of the effect we should engage people in the design and increase their sense of product ownership and brand loyalty. This way our designs will be loved more.</p>

    <h2>Inverted pyramid / Progressive disclosure</h2>

    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/inverted-pyramid.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/inverted-pyramid.jpg"/></a></p>
    <p>Inverted pyramid is method of funnelling functionality from user perspective.</p>
    <p>Don’t mix lucrative expectations into the developing user value.</p>
    <p>There are two reasons customers will be willing to pay for your product. One is they don’t want to bother finding it for free. Two is they genuinely want to reward you for the good work. Both scenarios involve you doing something for the people first. Users won’t buy anything unless it is of use for them.</p>
    <p>The inverted pyramid approach helps you clear out your vision and decide what to do first. In sum, this is what it’s about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify yourself</li>
        <li>Tell how you can help people</li>
        <li>Prove it</li>
        <li>Show you are more than that</li>
        <li>Prove it again</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A lot of companies confuse what they do with what people really need.</p>
    <p>Progressive disclosure is a motion from abstract to specific.</p>
    <p>There is always place for complexity. The customers have to ask for it though.</p>
    <p>The product has to speak to any user whether or not it has a history of relationship with them.</p>

    <h2>Kano model</h2>
    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@jmspool/understanding-the-kano-model-a-tool-for-sophisticated-designers-d91d092ad885" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Understanding the Kano Model — A Tool for Sophisticated Designers</strong></a></p>
    <p>The model becomes a great way to explain to stakeholders and project owners how to tackle hard decisions. It’s a great way to keep teams focused on the right priorities.</p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/sd/kano.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/sd/kano.png"/></a><br><em>The full Kano Model: A tool to predict user satisfaction.</em></p>
    <p><strong>The horizontal axis</strong> represents the investment the organization makes. As investment increases, the organization spends more resources on improving the quality (remember, Noriaka was a quality guy at heart) or adding new capabilities.<br>
    <strong>The vertical dimension</strong> represents the satisfaction of the user, moving from an extreme negative of frustration to an extreme positive of delight. (Neutral satisfaction being neither frustrated nor delighted is in the middle of the axis.)</p>
    <p>It’s against the backdrop of these two axes that we see how the Kano Model works. It shows us there are <strong>three forces at work</strong>, which we can use to predict our users’ satisfaction with the investment we make.</p>
    <p>By adding new features or cleaning up the quality of the product, we generate more shouts of delight from a thankful audience. This is the <strong>Performance Payoff</strong>, the most visible force of the Kano Model.</p>
    <p><strong>Basic Expectations</strong>: Capabilities that users expect will frustrate those users when they don’t work. However, when they work well, they don’t delight those users. <strong>A basic expectation, at best, can reach a neutral satisfaction a point where it, in essence, becomes invisible to the user.</strong></p>
    <p>A basic expectation may be something the user is already familiar with, such as automatically receiving a confirmation email after they complete a transaction. Your users may expect your product or service to have features they find in other products or services they frequent regularly.</p>
    <p>Exploring the users’ context and overall experience helps identify potential <strong>excitement generators</strong>. These don’t have to take a huge investment.</p>
    <p>Of course, excitement generators won’t delight users who are frustrated when you don’t meet their basic expectations. Designers need to ensure they are focusing on both ends of the model.</p>
    <p>One of the predictions that the Kano Model makes is that once customers become accustomed to excitement generator features, those features are not as delightful. The features initially become part of the performance payoff and then eventually migrate to basic expectations.</p>
    <p>Ursula Franklin: Each technology goes through 3 stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> excitement and promises</li>
        <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> acceptance, growth and standardisation</li>
        <li><strong>Institutionalisation:</strong> economic consolodation and stagnation</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>"The initial promise of liberation is never ever fulfilled."</em></p>
    <p><strong>Applying the Kano's model:</strong><br>
        Working with our clients, we’ve seen teams prioritize their work using the Kano Model. They’re constantly monitoring their users’ current basic expectations, to make sure there’s nothing they’re missing. They are always on the lookout for inexpensive ways to add excitement generators. And they use the performance payoff to help understand how much delight they can generate with new features.</p>

    <p><strong>Lean UX - What is it?</strong><br>
    Lean UX is focused on the experience under design and is less focused on deliverables than traditional UX. It requires a greater level of collaboration with the entire team. The core objective is to focus on obtaining feedback as early as possible so that it can be used to make quick decisions. The nature of Agile development is to work in rapid, iterative cycles and Lean UX mimics these cycles to ensure that data generated can be used in each iteration.</p>

    <p>Identifying UX metrics that tell the team’s story. Each UX outcome answers the question: <strong>"If we deliver a great design, how does it improve someone’s life?"</strong><br>
    The UX outcome is the end state we’re trying to achieve. Once we know our UX outcome, we can create key metrics detailing our journey getting there.</p>
    <p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/f360d769f719/what-is-your-mvp-216891" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Jared Spool - Shifting Our Team Goals to be UX Outcomes</strong></a></p>
    <p>A user experience outcome answers the question if we work hard and deliver great designs, how does that improve someone’s life? The person whose life we want to improve might be a customer, a non-paying user, an employee, or even someone who has never heard of us, but benefits because we’ve delivered a great user experience.</p>
    <p>The best UX outcome:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>come from research</li>
        <li>make an aspirational story</li>
        <li>are measurable</li>
        <li>drive great design</li>

    <p>A moment of truth is simply any interaction during which a customer may form an impression of your brand or product. This impression may be either positive or negative. The aim for the user experience designer is to try and ensure that moments of truth have a positive impact on the customer/user impression of the brand or product.</p>
    <p>Moments of truth are based on interactions with your product or brand that either make or break the user or customer experience. These moments of truth can be designed by UX or CX or Service Design professionals as long as they are aware of them and are able to talk to their users and customers to find out what will work for them.</p>

    <p>It's a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.</p>
    <p>The OKR framework was created by Intel CEO Andy Grove and brought to Google by venture capitalist John Doerr and has been used by several companies including Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Uber.</p>
    <p>The OKR framework aims to define company and team "objectives" along with linked and measurable "key results" to provide "a critical thinking framework and ongoing discipline that seeks to ensure employees work together, focusing their efforts to make measurable contributions." OKRs are typically set at the company, team and personal levels and may be shared across the organization with the intention of providing teams with visibility of goals with the intention to align and focus effort.</p>

    <p>t’s a recent feature that provides detailed information about a topic directly on the search results page.<br>
    These OneBoxes display GOV.UK content, and are powered by open standards markup we’ve added to the site.</p>
    <p>
        We added what’s known as structured data markup. This allows website publishers to provide detailed information about what specific sections of their pages are for. For example, if you’re publishing a recipe, there’s a standard way of indicating which bit of text is the cooking time.<br>
        GOV.UK have lots of step by step processes, including things like learning to drive and setting up a company. We’ve added markup to these pages, which allows search engines to provide this content to people in more useful ways.
    </p>
    <p>We’re big fans of this approach because it <strong>allows GOV.UK content to be used in new ways and on new platforms, without us having to build specific apps for these platforms</strong>.</p>
    <p>All our content will continue to be accessible in full on the GOV.UK website. But keeping pace with users' expectations means <strong>GOV.UK needs to be more than a website.</strong> We also need to be the <strong>trusted source of government information in search, voice, and wherever users take us next</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>UX questionnaire</strong>: when you start a new project. Set aside one hour to answer the following questions. Thid can feed into the project brief.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Team: who's responsible, who's in charge? who has approval power, who know about the product and why decisions were madewho should be kept in the loop?</li>
        <li>Goals: 3 to 5 is good, if more then ask the priorities</li>
        <li>Users: who are the target users, why do they use the product, primary motivation, passion, goals</li>
        <li>Strategy: why do people use the product, what's the vision, what's better than the competition</li>
        <li>tasks and scenarios: primary tasks the product should support </li>
        <li>success measures: what to track, whar define success</li>
        <li>Key dates and milestones: any significant dealine we should know about?</li>
        <li>Risk: any red flag I should see up front?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/ux-questionnaire.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/ux-questionnaire.jpg"/></a></p>
    <p><strong>UX project plan</strong>: if the project will go over a few weeks, it's probably a good thing to have, set aside 2 to 3 hours.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure you understand the goals of the project</li>
        <li>Brainstorm relevant methods </li>
        <li>Estimate duration</li>
        <li>Place milestones</li>
        <li>Create a simple document, doesn't have to be perfect, should be in the open if there is a dedicated space for the project</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Listening tour</strong>: about 5 to 8 hours, 1 hour to plan and schedule, 3 to 5 hours to interview people, and 1 to 2 hours to synthesize notes</p>
    <p><strong>Opportunity workshop</strong>: about 3 to 4 hours, 1 to plan, 2 to conduct the workshop, 1 to document what you learn. This is a good way to quickly assess the work to be done and how to improve the user experience, what's highest priority from a business perspective, and what will have the most impact from the suer's perspective.</p>
    <p><strong>Project brief</strong>: What are the expected outcome for this user-centered design project? - 2 to 3 hours, one to write it, and 2 to 3 to share with people (either 121 or in a group session)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Determine the right building blocks for your poject brief (business needs, user needs, goals, key expectations</li>
        <li>Write up what you know or your best guesses, into a short document</li>
        <li>Circulate the document</li>
        <li>Regularly revisit and make sure that you're on track</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Policy intent should be a simple, very human vision; not a target. Formalising it can lead to targets; leads to unintended consequences... Conversation with politicians is essential to extract the human vision. They usually have something close to it in their locker of rhetoric.</p>

    <p>A service blueprint is always constructed from the customer's perspective. A typical service blueprint identifies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customer Actions:</strong> The steps that customers take as part of the service delivery process.</li>
            <li><strong>Front-stage (Visible Contact Employee) Actions:</strong> Steps taken by contact employees as part of the face-to-face service encounter</li>
            <li><strong>Back-stage (Invisible Contact Employee) Actions:</strong> (The 'line of visibility' separates the front-stage and back-stage actions). Non-visible steps taken by contact employees behind the line of visibility. e.g. taking a hotel or restaurant reservation by telephone</li>
            <li><strong>Support Processes:</strong> Activities carried out by employees who are not contact employees, but whose actions are required for the service to be delivered</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Evidence:</strong> Tangible elements associated with each step that has the potential to influence customer perceptions of the service encounter e.g. uniforms, delivery vans</li>
            <li><strong>Inventory (if required):</strong> the amount of inventory build up required for each step</li>
            <li><strong>Line of Visibility:</strong> Line that separates front-stage and back-stage actions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Service blueprint are useful for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mapping end-to-end services that are linear </li>
            <li>Understanding how actions by service delivery staff affect the experience of service users </li>
            <li>Understanding the dynamics between systems, people, channels & more</li>
            <li>Helping siloed teams understand the whole service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Service blueprint are NOT useful for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mapping a journey from a single perspective - that’s a user journey </li>
            <li>Mapping complex or non-linear services. You can maybe adapt a blueprint for this but shouldn’t try and shoehorn them into the linear format</li>
            <li>Communicating things that are not services</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Spirales and arrows: An R means a reinforcing loop and a B means a balancing loop, they describe the effect on the wider system. The S and the O are sometimes also shown as + or – but basically S or + shows where the effect of one thing has the same effect on the next thing in the system, so same/same e.g more sun leads to more ice cream. O or – means it has the opposite effect on the next thing in the loop e.g more rain leads to less ice cream</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p><a href="https://good.services/blog/products-vs-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>How products and services work together - The School of Good Services</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/design-matters/2022/products-deliver-outputs-services-deliver-outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NHS Digital: Products deliver outputs, services deliver outcomes</strong></a></p>
    <p>Outputs are delivered by products or sub-services. They are tangible, for example a confirmation message via text, email or letter.</p>
    <p>Outcomes are the goal for the user, the solution to their problem. For example, having the medication in their or their carer's hand, with relevant instructions and the knowledge and skills to use it.</p>
    <p>Outputs and outcomes are both essential to the delivery of a service, but it is important to be clear which is being used to assess effectiveness.</p>
    <p>Services add value to products. Providing a service means that the user doesn't have to know how to do something or is not able to do it</p>
    <p><strong>Most of what we deliver are services, so we must design them like services</strong></p>
    <p>The definitions for services and products:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>a service</strong> is everything the user needs to do to achieve a goal, as described by the Government Digital Service (GDS). Services are generally intangible, delivering outcomes via a single or set of products and other touchpoints. An example would be 'Get vaccinated for coronavirus'</li>
        <li><strong>a product</strong> is tangible. It's something that exists in real life, or for example as code on a server. Products deliver outputs. An example would be any of the websites, apps, or APIs we have</li>
        <li><strong>a business platform</strong> enables the exchange of values between 2 parties. An example would be eBay</li>
    </ul>
    <p>the website or the app is the product and if we only focus on that, we don't achieve the outcomes. The services you can access via the app deliver the outcome, for example 'order a repeat prescription', not the app itself.</p>
    <p><strong>Most of what we do is service design</strong></p>
    <p>Service design is the process of orchestrating the end-to-end service from when the users become aware of the service, to when they exit and everything in between.</p>
    <p>Service design is about designing the full stack top-to-bottom, from the visible touchpoints to the back-end systems and the policies, standards and target operating models.</p>
    <p>Service design must also be cross-channel and not just focusing on the digital. Telephone, face-to-face, paper and assisted digital channels must also be designed as one service - not separate channels.</p>
    <p>This end-to-end, top-to-bottom and cross-channel view also means that the staff members delivering the day-to-day service are also our users, and they have user needs. We should not just focus on the public or the patient.</p>
    <p>Service design is what ties all these together, with teams that are multi-disciplinary, with a diverse set of skills and perspectives, and by forming wider service communities empowered to solve the whole problem.</p>
<br>
    <p><strong>Service communities</strong> should not just be about sharing ideas and talking about the service, but actively discuss issues, performance, user research findings and other feedback loops, prioritise backlogs, and come up with hypotheses and plans how to validate them. Together, as one service community, the teams can then agree who is in the best place to solve a particular problem.</p>
    <p>Through collaboration they are more likely to be able to solve the problem, deliver the service, and achieve the outcome, not simply deliver their outputs in isolation of each other.</p>

    <h2>Wireframe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>blueprint for a site or app layout</li>
        <li>show important functionality</li>
        <li>conveys content type and grouping </li>
        <li>show information hierarchy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They quickly generate ideas, aids discussion, show content hierarchy and establish key functionality.<br>
        They can be static, code-based, for layout, information architecture or wireflow. <br>
        Static: They are quick to create, there is a variety of tools and software but wireframe are not responsive.<br>
        code-based one are: responsive, interactive, in the browser but they can take longer to do, require coding knowledge, and might be difficult to interprete.
        </p>
    <p>For example below with Adobe Illustrator: show real content (Static)</p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe1.png"/></a></p>
    <p><strong>wireflow (= hydrid of flow chart + wireframe)</strong></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe2.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Balsamic, Omnigraffle, InVision, Sktech, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop Adobe XD (static wireframe)<br>
            Axure, Pattern Lab, GTML and CSS (code based wireframe)<br>
            High fidelity can be harder to understand for less technical people or can be confused with the real thing.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Annotations: </strong><br>
        Add labels to important features<br>
        Explain Key functionality<br>
        what happens in different states<br>
        Anything that isn't self explanatory
        </p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe3.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Wireframe appear very early in the design process.<br>
        Consideration to have: content needs, purpose, audience, fidelity, tools, annotation and documentation.<br>
        Wireframe planning: define the main purpose, what type of information is needed, what functionality is necessary and assign priority<br>        
        You can purchases components to make quicks wireframes: uxkits.com<br>
        To start, you ideally need: some discovery brief, competitive analysis, UR reports, Analytics, Site maps, Technical requirements, SEO recommendations, User personas

    <p><strong>Task flows : how will the experience unfold over time</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>figure out your starting point</li>
        <li>consider what comes next (or prior)</li>
        <li>think about entries and exits: think of what would happen if someone abandon and come back later</li>
        <li>add annotations: how transitions take place, things that are not self evident from looking at the task flows</li>
        <li>keep it lightweight - post it notes are good</li>
        <li>don't boil the ocean: create discrete flows and focus on core scenarios</li>
        <li>use as a starting point for a clickable prototype</li>
        <li>think multichannel, you can use experience blueprint instead</li>

    <p><strong>Wireframes</strong>: skeletal depiction of what a product should look like. Show how the whole system hangs together to create a complete, interconnected strucutre that stands together as a whole.</p>
    <p>They are susually black and white. They illustrate touch points in a service or the different parts of a product. They focus on the basic, what navigation is available. They include notes and annotations about the behaviour of the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>create a wireframe inventory (make a list of those you think you need)</li>
        <li>get wireframing: sequence and state / information density / grid / design principles / error messages and states</li>
        <li>seek and listen to feedback</li>
