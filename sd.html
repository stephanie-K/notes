                </p>
                <p><strong>The difference between the Scottish approach to SD and a regular approach to SD (From twitter - Cat Macaulay)</strong></p>
                <p>This is an attempt to create a shared collaborative approach to designing public services in Scotland. We are co-producing the approach based on collective thinking and actions across orgs and sectors that design and / or deliver public services in Scotland.<br> 
                    That currently includes many people and service design champions from various parts NHS in Scotland, as well as many different public bodies, local authorities, private and third sector orgs.<br>
                    It's happening because often multiple orgs need to collaborate to deliver a service journey for citizens but they find it hard/impossible to collaborate on designing that journey for all sorts of reasons.<br>
                    To improve the ability of multiple orgs delivering a public service journey to collaborate on designing that journey we need a shared understanding of how to design a public service in Scotland and some basic shared tools, values and principles, methods, capabilities etc.<br>
                    So part of #SAtSD is working out what those shared things should be and working together to create them and the right conditions for collaboration.<br>
                    It's also happening because @scotgov has a longstanding commitment to working with and not just for citizens. That applies to designing and delivering public services as much as making policy.<br>
                    That means #SAtSD is about a massive effort to put citizens at the heart of all public service design in Scotland - creating conditions so we (public and govt service orgs) in Scotland ensure citizen participation in service design from project inception to live service.<br>
                    We aim to get much - much! - better at encouraging, empowering and enabling all citizens to participate deeply and fairly in designing the services they need. And we mean all. So finally...<br>
                    We need to redesign #servicedesign itself to be more radically #inclusive and #accessible. #SAtSD will fail if some citizens (eg disabled people, people in remote areas,  or people with low literacy levels) can’t participate as easily as others.<br>
                    PS a wee spin off benefit of making this a thing would be -  if we can get brilliant at encouraging, empowering and enabling all citizens to participate in the design of all Scotland’s public services, we’d turn Scotland into the biggest design school in the world.

                    <p>We need to understand users, their contexts, needs, and capabilities, and build the service around this.<br>
                        When redesigning a service, we need to simplify, reduce the complexity. number of steps, humanise language and reinterpret policy.</p>
                    <p>A service is a thing to help users, citizens or civil servants achieve a goal.<br>
                        The context in which they find out about and then do the thing is important.<br>
                    It always starts with a need and an idea of the outcome but not a clear idea of how it will be achieved.</p>

        <h2>General</h2>
    
        <p>Service Design is a user-centred approach to designing and creating all of the products and services a person needs to "solve a whole problem"</p>
        <p>Service Design aims to create an integrated consistent, positive experience across an enitre user journey across channels and over time</p>
        <p>Part of it will be a content strategy to make sure the content delivered is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>in the right place</li>
            <li>at the right time</li>
            <li>to the right user</li>
            <li>distributed across the right channels</li>
            <li>using consistent language</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>= Give uses the information they need when they need it</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In the front-stage, we design products and services for meaningful customer experiences. In the back-stage, we design processes, rituals and training to create outstanding employee engagement, cultural change and optimised tools.</strong></p>

        <p class="lead"><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/9-principles-of-service-design-3486a097b10e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>9 Principles of Service Design (Nielsen Norman)</strong></a></p>
        <p>According to Nielsen Norman, service design is: The activity of planning and organizing a business’s resources (people, props, and processes) in order to (1) directly improve the employee’s experience, and (2) indirectly, the customer’s experience.</p>
        <p>An interface is not a service. A product is not a service. A service is not a physical object and cannot be possessed.</p>
        <p>9 basic categories or ways in which organizations can improve service design.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NOT placing the business needs before the user’s needs</li>
            <li>NOT making it hard to achieve the goal</li>
            <li>personalising the service</li>
            <li>before you even knew you needed it</li>
            <li>the follow-up</li>
            <li>mitigating the wait</li>
            <li>Peak-end Rule (in memory, we remember the peak and ending of an experience in greater detail)</li>
            <li>the runaround (being passed from one person/thing to the next)</li>
            <li>duplicate efforts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, the user experience is an entire ecosystem extending far beyond the boundaries of an interface or product. Service is part of that ecosystem. And to adequately address service design, we must map the experience to identify systemic failures along with organizational policies resulting in a poor experience for the user.</p>
        <p class="lead"><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/service-design-and-ux-design-whats-the-difference-508c41c65217" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Service Design and UX Design - what's the difference</strong></a></p>
        <p>Service designers aim to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>understand thoroughly the service proposition of the organisation or company in question</li>
            <li>discern the needs of all the stakeholders and actors in a service — both customers and service providers</li>
            <li>map out the service through a service ecology, service blueprint, and user journeys</li>
            <li>co-create possible solutions or improvements by collaborating with service stakeholders</li>
            <li>prototype and pilot new service experiences with real customers and staff</li>
            <li>zoom in and out constantly between the details of individual touchpoints and the design of the overall service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Service design starts by looking to make improvement in people, processes, assets and culture. That then indirectly goes on to influence the customer experience.</p>

    <p class="lead">Don't make me think - Steve Krug:</p>
    <p><strong>Satisficing</strong>: when user scan a page, they look at the available options but most of the time they chose the first reasonable option, not the best one.</p>
    <p><strong>We don't figure out how things work, we muddle through</strong>:<br>
        For most of us, it doesn't matter how things work, as long as we can use them. It's not for lack of intelligence but for lack of caring. In the great scheme of things, it's just non important to us.<br>
        If we find something that works, we stick to it. Once we find something that works no matter how badly, we tend not to look for a better way. We'll use a better way if we stumble across one, but we seldom look for one.<br>
        Muddling tends to be inefficient and error prone though.

    <ul>
        <li>instant feedback after every action confirms their effect</li>
        <li>don’t expect patience from them</li>
        <li>don’t rely on copy if possible</li>
        <li>small kids take everything literally</li>
        <li>trust doesn’t only mean giving consistent feedback but also that their parents can rely on our product for their kids’ safety</li>
        <li>use age groups, challenge them age-appropriately</li>
        <li>design for kids is still paid for by parents — always take them into consideration, too</li>

    <h3>Design Language System</h3>
    <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/design-language-system-d438f4aa30e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Medium : Design Language System</strong></a></p>
    <p> A Design Language System is a set of rules or guidelines that heightens the level of harmony in a digital ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Now what is a digital ecosystem? It is nothing but interdependent group of enterprises, people or things that share a standardized digital platform for mutually beneficial purposes. To keep this ecosystem in harmony we need to understand the different groups involved, their requirements and expectations to build a wholesome design system that is scalable and efficient at the same time. This interdependent group of enterprises/people/things is where all of you (designers, developers) come in. All you should be doing is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get everyone ready and on the same page</li>
            <li>Collaborate at healthy intervals to curate a wholesome design language system</li>
            <li>Keep in mind the collective desire to provide good user experience while adding to internal efficiency</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The Design Language System is like setting a foundation for you to build on. It’ll make the build time shorter and much more efficient. </p>

    <p><a href="https://medium.com/foolproof-ux/do-make-me-think-cacd25be0458" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>On Medium</strong></a></p>
    <p>Helping people make better decisions sometimes means designing complex interactions.<br>
        The world seems to think that the only outcome the customer is interested in is speed, but there are other outcomes we should be designing for: confidence; a sense of control; the suitability of a product or service that users need. Designers need to recognise that the flow needs moments of reflection and focus. Making the user stop and consider their decisions may add time, but — done well — it needn’t detract from a smooth sense of flow in an experience. Essential information points should not be so easily glossed over or missed, but highlighted and featured as important points of reference.
        </p>
    <p>There is a necessary complexity to many interactions, putting these processes online and on a phone changes the dynamic, but it doesn’t reduce the complexity, or the risk. They are complex by their very nature, requiring thought and consideration.</p>

        <li>Deliver /Implementation— solutions that work (converging)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Stage 1 — Doing the right thing (Diamond 1 — Discover and Define)</p>
    <p>Stage 2 — Doing things right (Diamond 2 — Develop and Deliver)</p>

    <p>Ways to influence the product owners</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>number 1 rule: respect</strong> - The thing with humans is, quite often, we think other people know what we know. Or everyone remembers the way we remember. It’s simply not the case. Sometimes, people genuinely come to daft conclusions because they don’t know something or they remember a meeting in an entirely different way to us. That’s because they have different baggage they bring with them. By remembering this, you start to get an idea that someone isn’t ‘blocking’ you; they are just in a different space with different information. To get your idea across really well, you need to bridge that gap between what you think you both know and what you actually know.</li>
        <li><strong>show, don't tell</strong> - When you are talking to someone about a new idea, have something to show. It can be bits of paper with line drawings on, little prototypes, someone else’s data that supports your idea – anything. When talking in the abstract, you are allowing people to fill in gaps in their head – they may not tell you what they are thinking but still say no. Have something tangible to look at, point at, and work out.</li>
        <li><strong>get out of the room</strong> - Use data and show that it's not your opinion but Research, studies showing something is not right. It's harder to fight research than fight your opinion or advice</li>
        <li><strong>use the silence</strong> - Often, if you are quiet, people just keep talking to fill the void. When they do that, they can, quite literally, talk themselves around. Don’t feel the need to speak in natural pauses. Let them do it. Sometimes, if you are bringing a new idea out of the blue, people need to think about it. Some people do that while talking. What I am saying is, give them a chance and stay  quiet. This is also the time when they tell you about all the stuff they thought you knew, or thought you didn’t need to know</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOV.UK - Structuring forms</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/designing-more-efficient-forms-structure-inputs-labels-and-actions-e3a47007114f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Designing More Efficient Forms: Structure, Inputs, Labels and Actions</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-ux-behind-designing-better-forms-d6ebe7a817d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>On UX Design</strong></a></p>
    <p><strong>Align the sections:</strong> Alignment is nothing but arranging text in the most efficient way- allowing for efficient, effective scanning and limiting errors or missed fields. Basically, having the label text as close to the input field makes the grouping more relatable. It is easier to associate them due to their proximity.</p>
    <p><strong>Group related fields:</strong> Grouping information into chunks is an easy way to highlight association. If the form has more than six fields, it is recommended to group them into logical sections. These steps are even more emphasised if each section is given their respective header, and are neatly arranged in a top-down order.</p>
    <p><strong>Write clear labels:</strong> Using succinct and crisp labels. It helps the user understand what information is required in one glance. Avoid using complete sentences to explain simple questions, just one or two words generally suffice.</p>
    <p><strong>Input field format:</strong> design the input fields in a customised manner, which explicitly shows how the information is to be fed in.</p>
    <p><strong>Adding visual cues:</strong> Giving a few suggestions upfront is a good way to get their thoughts running. And representing these options with additional visual cues can turn out to be even better, as it requires minimal cognitive load and provides a direction of thought.</p>
    <p><strong>Optional vs compulsory:</strong> This is a very simple trick to de-clutter a form page. Rather than mentioning ‘compulsory’ next to every header, just put an asterisk and mention the optional ones in words. See also: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nielsen Norman: Marking Required Fields in Forms</strong></a> but keep in mind GDS guidance differ</p>
    <p><strong>CTA call to action:</strong> CTAs can either look like a solid rectangular button, or a text link. Depending on your use case, make sure that only ONE of them is the prominent one. Mention what’s going to happen once you hit on the button. This clarity is essential for great CTAs.</p>
    <p><strong>Use colours efficiently:</strong> Colours can be cleverly used to direct the user’s attention, and add an aesthetic appeal to the design. The trick is to <strong>stick to not more than 2 main colours in the page</strong>. Just make sure to use them wisely, keeping the main goal of the form in mind.</p>
    <p><strong>Validate the form:</strong> 3 important messages that a good form validation should convey to the user:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>an error has occurred. Display clearly that there is an error in the form, preferably using a red color signal to attract attention</li>
        <li>where the error occurred: Highlighting the fields that caused the error</li>
        <li>how the error can be repaired: Provide information on what needs to be different in order for the field to validate</li>

    <h3>Gamification</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/gamification-user-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nielsen Norman video: Gamification in the User Experience</strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/notes_gamification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My notes from the IDF course (19 pages)</a></p>
    <p><strong>Gamification is the art of adding game-like elements to experiences which traditionally do not involve fun or games.</strong> As it’s a young industry, it should be easier to get a “foot in the door” of gamification companies with demand for experienced designers far outstripping supply, and that means those businesses are going to be keen to take a chance on less-experienced but well-qualified designers.</p>
    <p>A review of the literature to date has shown a positive correlation that<strong> gamification does increase the effectiveness of the activity it is applied to</strong>. Of course, a lot depends on how gamification is used – a gamification can only work if the players find it motivating, interesting and fun. </p>
    <p><strong>The “Player-Centered Design” approach</strong> involves using the following five steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>know your player</li>
        <li>identify the mission</li>
        <li>understand human motivation</li>
        <li>apply mechanics</li>
        <li>manage, monitor and measure</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/player-centered-Design.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/player-centered-Design.png"/></a></p>
    <p><strong>The Four Basic Principles of Fun in a Game:</strong> Goals, Rules, Feedback, Voluntary Participation</p>

    <p class="lead">A SMART mission</p>
    <p>It enables you to communicate to the gamification team not just what needs to be addressed through the project but also how you will be able to demonstrate success at the end of the project. The SMART goal-setting system is a remarkably effective tool that can help you define and fine-tune the real solution. It lets you remove all the obstacles that would otherwise lead to your arriving at false solutions.<br>
        If you understand what the situation is and what situation is required, it should be easy to build a SMART mission which promotes the success of your gamification exercise.<br>
        Gamification projects aren’t just about players; we also use them to achieve business results. Your gamification design team must research exactly what the business expects and ensure that everyone involved in the project focusses on these expectations throughout the design process. The idea is to create engagement with players that achieves results and return on investment. Getting the balance between fun engagement and serious results will pay off time and again for you as you progress to later gamification works in your career.

        <p>In games, documentation can be used as a guiding force. Game design documentation can be short (1 page) or long (past 30 pages), but it always helps creators define game elements up front. Translating this to digital product design, this can be a document that outlines personas, user goals, and other information such as key statistics to track. This can help people who need information about current and upcoming projects to get going as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>If you decide to prioritize documentation, remember to write it as you go. It is more tedious to do everything at the end than to spend 15 minutes sharing updates every few days. There are lots of programs and apps you can use; InVision, Google Drive, and Basecamp are just a few. They all make it incredibly convenient to be a better communicator.</p>
        <li><strong>Simple isn’t always best</strong></li>
        <p>Complexity is important in games because it provides challenges for players to overcome. Game makers excel at ensuring the addition of complex features include usefulness and meaning. If every part of a game is complicated, players will quit. However, the right amount of roadblocks can make players feel accomplished when they are surpassed.</p>
        <p>Many apps are challenging to master, but worth the reward. This effort makes users feel like pros. For example, I am a loyal Sketch user because I know the ins and outs of the product. Finding new features and shortcuts gives me a sense of accomplishment. Consider ways to do the same in your product, especially if user goals require it to support a complex set of actions.</p>
        <li><strong>Connect through emotions and personality</strong></li>
        <p>Journey mapping is the process of mapping out how a user in a specific scenario feels during each step of a specific set of tasks. Journey mapping an existing set of features can help designers understand where improvements can be made, and journey mapping while creating user flows for new projects enables designers to avoid potential pitfalls.<br>
        In addition to emotions, people love personality. They want to identify with those behind the products they use and the games they play. In games, this is usually expressed through hidden secrets called easter eggs. Game designers use them to connect with players while rewarding them with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
        <li><strong>Give feedback</strong></li>
        <p>Responsiveness is important in games. It gives players the sense that their actions are contributing to changes shown on screen. In games, this feedback is known as “game feel” or “juice”. It is often expressed as screen shaking and changes in scale and color of objects.</p>
        <li><strong>Be intentional</strong></li>
        <p>Game elements shine when they are intentionally included. Users can tell when an experience is game-like as a gimmick. If you are considering the addition of game elements into your experiences, carefully think about their purpose.</p>

    <h3>Hick's Law: Making the choice easier for users</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users?r=stephanie-krus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong></strong></a></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/hicks.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/ux/hicks.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that <strong>the more stimuli (or choices) users face, the longer it will take them to make a decision.</strong> For designers of all types, this presents a challenge, making it imperative to offer the most useful set of options to avoid frustrating the user. This can be vital for safety. The U.S. Navy was quick to recognize the importance of the “Keep It Simple and Straightforward” (“K.I.S.S.”) principle, which reflects Hick’s Law.</p>
    <p>As web designers, we have an important choice to make before presenting users with the choices we hope they will select on our sites. We have to use Hick’s Law in conjunction with other design principles, especially on the landing page to make the most-desired option/s stand out.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, there’s no avoiding complexity, especially if we’re involved with presenting a huge amount of needed information about sophisticated products or intricate services. Using Hick’s Law can help us reduce that complexity by simplifying the decision-making process for our users.</p>
    <p>To make our designs work, we need to remember that a) the user’s time is precious, and b) a user is not obligated to stay on our site. To enhance the user experience, we should consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>categorizing Choice</strong> – Enabling users to find items from higher categories, as if they were looking under sections in a library.</li>
        <li><strong>obscuring Complexity</strong> – Breaking up long or complex processes into screens with fewer options.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once your website or app is live, you can use variables such as “time on site” and “page views” to understand if Hick’s law has been applied correctly.</p>
    <p>Overall, remember that Hick’s Law is a guideline you can adapt to your design. Always try to “flip” the perspective to see the choices you want to present from the outside. Avoid flooding with options, but bear in mind the balance between users’ time and comfort zones for handling options on a page. Guiding them to select between clear options that will get them somewhere quickly (such as a shopping cart) will take the work out of the user experience and reward you both.</p>
    <p>As a user experience designer, you have a great ally in the card-sorting method. Keep in mind that you 1) first need to find out who are your users and what they need, 2) then define the functionalities your product and service will offer to meet these needs, and 3) use methods such as card sorting to build the right categorization and labels for these categories.</p>

    <h3>IKEA effect</h3>
    <p>The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that can influence the outcome and perceived value of products to a big degree. People tend to place high value on products they partially have created.<br>
        The more the needs for customization and co-production are present in your target audience the more the IKEA effect is relevant for you as a designer. The effect can help you instil feelings of competence in the user when the task is completed successfully.<br>
        The IKEA effect will create stronger bond between the user and the product. The effort that users will put into completing the product to a complete state will transform into love for that product. The subjective value will be higher in comparison to a product that hasn’t cost any effort.
        </p>
    <p>It is important to point out that <strong>the IKEA effect is not about putting the effort be it small or big, it is more about the completion of the task.</strong> The IKEA effect is present when <strong>the user can enjoy the completed task and the product.</strong> If the product is disassembled soon after the assembling the effect is lost.</p>
    <p><strong>Sometimes saving the users a bit of labour could deprive them from a bit more happiness if they were to make the small effort.</strong> Think if you should decrease the user effort to zero or close to zero.</p>
    <p>To make use of the effect we should engage people in the design and increase their sense of product ownership and brand loyalty. This way our designs will be loved more.</p>

    <h3>Inverted pyramid / Progressive disclosure</h3>

    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/inverted-pyramid.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/inverted-pyramid.jpg"/></a></p>
    <p>Inverted pyramid is method of funnelling functionality from user perspective.</p>
    <p>Don’t mix lucrative expectations into the developing user value.</p>
    <p>There are two reasons customers will be willing to pay for your product. One is they don’t want to bother finding it for free. Two is they genuinely want to reward you for the good work. Both scenarios involve you doing something for the people first. Users won’t buy anything unless it is of use for them.</p>
    <p>The inverted pyramid approach helps you clear out your vision and decide what to do first. In sum, this is what it’s about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify yourself</li>
        <li>Tell how you can help people</li>
        <li>Prove it</li>
        <li>Show you are more than that</li>
        <li>Prove it again</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A lot of companies confuse what they do with what people really need.</p>
    <p>Progressive disclosure is a motion from abstract to specific.</p>
    <p>There is always place for complexity. The customers have to ask for it though.</p>
    <p>The product has to speak to any user whether or not it has a history of relationship with them.</p>

    <h3>Kano model</h3>
    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@jmspool/understanding-the-kano-model-a-tool-for-sophisticated-designers-d91d092ad885" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Understanding the Kano Model — A Tool for Sophisticated Designers</strong></a></p>
    <p>The model becomes a great way to explain to stakeholders and project owners how to tackle hard decisions. It’s a great way to keep teams focused on the right priorities.</p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/sd/kano.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/sd/kano.png"/></a><br><em>The full Kano Model: A tool to predict user satisfaction.</em></p>
    <p><strong>The horizontal axis</strong> represents the investment the organization makes. As investment increases, the organization spends more resources on improving the quality (remember, Noriaka was a quality guy at heart) or adding new capabilities.<br>
    <strong>The vertical dimension</strong> represents the satisfaction of the user, moving from an extreme negative of frustration to an extreme positive of delight. (Neutral satisfaction being neither frustrated nor delighted is in the middle of the axis.)</p>
    <p>It’s against the backdrop of these two axes that we see how the Kano Model works. It shows us there are <strong>three forces at work</strong>, which we can use to predict our users’ satisfaction with the investment we make.</p>
    <p>By adding new features or cleaning up the quality of the product, we generate more shouts of delight from a thankful audience. This is the <strong>Performance Payoff</strong>, the most visible force of the Kano Model.</p>
    <p><strong>Basic Expectations</strong>: Capabilities that users expect will frustrate those users when they don’t work. However, when they work well, they don’t delight those users. <strong>A basic expectation, at best, can reach a neutral satisfaction a point where it, in essence, becomes invisible to the user.</strong></p>
    <p>A basic expectation may be something the user is already familiar with, such as automatically receiving a confirmation email after they complete a transaction. Your users may expect your product or service to have features they find in other products or services they frequent regularly.</p>
    <p>Exploring the users’ context and overall experience helps identify potential <strong>excitement generators</strong>. These don’t have to take a huge investment.</p>
    <p>Of course, excitement generators won’t delight users who are frustrated when you don’t meet their basic expectations. Designers need to ensure they are focusing on both ends of the model.</p>
    <p>One of the predictions that the Kano Model makes is that once customers become accustomed to excitement generator features, those features are not as delightful. The features initially become part of the performance payoff and then eventually migrate to basic expectations.</p>
    <p>Ursula Franklin: Each technology goes through 3 stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> excitement and promises</li>
        <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> acceptance, growth and standardisation</li>
        <li><strong>Institutionalisation:</strong> economic consolodation and stagnation</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>"The initial promise of liberation is never ever fulfilled."</em></p>
    <p><strong>Applying the Kano's model:</strong><br>
        Working with our clients, we’ve seen teams prioritize their work using the Kano Model. They’re constantly monitoring their users’ current basic expectations, to make sure there’s nothing they’re missing. They are always on the lookout for inexpensive ways to add excitement generators. And they use the performance payoff to help understand how much delight they can generate with new features.</p>

    Lean UX is focused on the experience under design and is less focused on deliverables than traditional UX. It requires a greater level of collaboration with the entire team. The core objective is to focus on obtaining feedback as early as possible so that it can be used to make quick decisions. The nature of Agile development is to work in rapid, iterative cycles and Lean UX mimics these cycles to ensure that data generated can be used in each iteration.</p>

    <p>A moment of truth is simply any interaction during which a customer may form an impression of your brand or product. This impression may be either positive or negative. The aim for the user experience designer is to try and ensure that moments of truth have a positive impact on the customer/user impression of the brand or product.</p>
    <p>Moments of truth are based on interactions with your product or brand that either make or break the user or customer experience. These moments of truth can be designed by UX or CX or Service Design professionals as long as they are aware of them and are able to talk to their users and customers to find out what will work for them.</p>

    <p><strong>UX questionnaire</strong>: when you start a new project. Set aside one hour to answer the following questions. Thid can feed into the project brief.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Team: who's responsible, who's in charge? who has approval power, who know about the product and why decisions were madewho should be kept in the loop?</li>
        <li>Goals: 3 to 5 is good, if more then ask the priorities</li>
        <li>Users: who are the target users, why do they use the product, primary motivation, passion, goals</li>
        <li>Strategy: why do people use the product, what's the vision, what's better than the competition</li>
        <li>tasks and scenarios: primary tasks the product should support </li>
        <li>success measures: what to track, whar define success</li>
        <li>Key dates and milestones: any significant dealine we should know about?</li>
        <li>Risk: any red flag I should see up front?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>UX project plan</strong>: if the project will go over a few weeks, it's probably a good thing to have, set aside 2 to 3 hours.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure you understand the goals of the project</li>
        <li>Brainstorm relevant methods </li>
        <li>Estimate duration</li>
        <li>Place milestones</li>
        <li>Create a simple document, doesn't have to be perfect, should be in the open if there is a dedicated space for the project</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Listening tour</strong>: about 5 to 8 hours, 1 hour to plan and schedule, 3 to 5 hours to interview people, and 1 to 2 hours to synthesize notes</p>
    <p><strong>Opportunity workshop</strong>: about 3 to 4 hours, 1 to plan, 2 to conduct the workshop, 1 to document what you learn. This is a good way to quickly assess the work to be done and how to improve the user experience, what's highest priority from a business perspective, and what will have the most impact from the suer's perspective.</p>
    <p><strong>Project brief</strong>: What are the expected outcome for this user-centered design project? - 2 to 3 hours, one to write it, and 2 to 3 to share with people (either 121 or in a group session)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Determine the right building blocks for your poject brief (business needs, user needs, goals, key expectations</li>
        <li>Write up what you know or your best guesses, into a short document</li>
        <li>Circulate the document</li>
        <li>Regularly revisit and make sure that you're on track</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Strategy workshop</strong>: there's a lot to it, this is on page 108</p>

    <h3>Wireframe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>blueprint for a site or app layout</li>
        <li>show important functionality</li>
        <li>conveys content type and grouping </li>
        <li>show information hierarchy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They quickly generate ideas, aids discussion, show content hierarchy and establish key functionality.<br>
        They can be static, code-based, for layout, information architecture or wireflow. <br>
        Static: They are quick to create, there is a variety of tools and software but wireframe are not responsive.<br>
        code-based one are: responsive, interactive, in the browser but they can take longer to do, require coding knowledge, and might be difficult to interprete.
        </p>
    <p>For example below with Adobe Illustrator: show real content (Static)</p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe1.png"/></a></p>
    <p><strong>wireflow (= hydrid of flow chart + wireframe)</strong></p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe2.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Balsamic, Omnigraffle, InVision, Sktech, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop Adobe XD (static wireframe)<br>
            Axure, Pattern Lab, GTML and CSS (code based wireframe)<br>
            High fidelity can be harder to understand for less technical people or can be confused with the real thing.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Annotations: </strong><br>
        Add labels to important features<br>
        Explain Key functionality<br>
        what happens in different states<br>
        Anything that isn't self explanatory
        </p>
    <p><a href="assets/images/ux/wireframe3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/ux/wireframe3.png"/></a></p>
    <p>Wireframe appear very early in the design process.<br>
        Consideration to have: content needs, purpose, audience, fidelity, tools, annotation and documentation.<br>
        Wireframe planning: define the main purpose, what type of information is needed, what functionality is necessary and assign priority<br>        
        You can purchases components to make quicks wireframes: uxkits.com<br>
        To start, you ideally need: some discovery brief, competitive analysis, UR reports, Analytics, Site maps, Technical requirements, SEO recommendations, User personas

    <p><strong>Task flows : how will the experience unfold over time</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>figure out your starting point</li>
        <li>consider what comes next (or prior)</li>
        <li>think about entries and exits: think of what would happen if someone abandon and come back later</li>
        <li>add annotations: how transitions take place, things that are not self evident from looking at the task flows</li>
        <li>keep it lightweight - post it notes are good</li>
        <li>don't boil the ocean: create discrete flows and focus on core scenarios</li>
        <li>use as a starting point for a clickable prototype</li>
        <li>think multichannel, you can use experience blueprint instead</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Wireframes</strong>: skeletal depiction of what a product should look like. Show how the whole system hangs together to create a complete, interconnected strucutre that stands together as a whole.</p>
    <p>They are susually black and white. They illustrate touch points in a service or the different parts of a product. They focus on the basic, what navigation is available. They include notes and annotations about the behaviour of the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>create a wireframe inventory (make a list of those you think you need)</li>
        <li>get wireframing: sequence and state / information density / grid / design principles / error messages and states</li>
        <li>seek and listen to feedback</li>
    </ul>
