            <h2>AWS - Amazon Web Services</h2>
            <p>Netflix for example depends on it. Companies turn to AWS because of cost and scalability. You only pay for what you use.It also reduces latency as you can get your server closer to your user simple because they have the highest number of servers.</p>
            <p>Microsof Azure is the biggest competitor and started providing cloud services around 2010</p>
            <p>Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) is one of the core service of AWS</p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/aws-ec2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/aws-ec2.png"/></a></p>
            <p>Instances running computing operations can increase or decrease at will, you can also have more or less storage with elastic block storage.</p>
            <p>Simple Storage Services (S3) stores files, the maximum file size is 5 terabyte .</p>
            <p>Relational Database Service (RDS) - AWS handles everything for you, including their security</p>
            <p>Route53 = Domain Name system (system that translates human-readable URL to IP addresses</p>

            <h2>Chatbot - Conversation interface - Dialogflow - voice input</h2>
            <p><a href="https://guild.co/blog/five-reasons-why-chatbots-will-transform-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Five reasons why chatbots will transform customer service</strong></a></p>
            <p>Armed with today’s technological advancements, chatbots are much more user friendly and can carry out tasks and answer questions without pre-programming. Users don’t need to know the proper diction and syntax to get the answers they need. They can simply ask a question as they would say them conversationally. And this is why one of the leading use cases for chatbots is in customer service.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>immediate 24/7 coverage: </strong>Chatbots can assist customers immediately without needing to wait on hold or in a queue. </li>
                <li><strong>Better customer engagement: </strong>Most customer-facing bots are programmed to engage in a positive tone while providing exact, concise answers. Bots also address another customer engagement issue pertinent in today’s global marketplace: the language barrier. Chatbots programmed to translate can engage customers who may not speak the same language as the customer service agents</li>
                <li><strong>Serving as a job aid for any employee: </strong>Chatbots synced to internal programs like CRM, ERP or accounting systems can help locate customer information immediately while the agent converses with the customer. This level of convenience can aid nearly any position in a company.Chatbots can serve as a convenient sidekick for seasoned employees while at the same time help less experienced employees feel more confident and competent faster than they would otherwise. Companies can also reduce the amount of time it takes to train new customer service agents when they can get up to speed faster with the aid of a bot.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved work satisfaction: </strong>By allowing chatbots to answer typical high-volume, simple questions, customer service agents will then add more value by taking on mostly complex or personal queries. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/voice-input-the-interface-problem-1700be45ec18" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Voice input: the interface problem</strong></a></p>
            <p>The issue with voice input is not the technology, it’s the interface.<br>
                In these systems, the intent of the spoken command may be high or low utility. The user’s utility doesn’t matter. High utility tasks are focused and specific, while low utility tasks are vague and hard to decipher. The system determines the utility of the user’s words according to its own needs. <br>
                These systems don’t deal in language as most linguists would define it. It’s a false model of language in which each statement should have a logical flow and intent because it serves their purpose in structuring a transaction of goods or information. 
            </p>
            <p>But real people don’t talk that way. This incompatibility between the transactional needs of the systems and the non-logical, unstructured form of human speech leads to errors and misunderstandings. Eliminating error and misunderstanding is the biggest challenge faced by the designers of voice input systems. Companies designing apps for Alexa and her sisters are encouraged to create a strong error strategy — to assume that misunderstanding, lack of understanding, and not hearing are the default outcomes.</p>
            <p>An important aspect of all human conversations is the assumption of shared understanding. People get really angry when they are asked to clarify statements that seem obvious to them.</p>
            <p>Because voice input technologies need all interactions to lead to a transaction, they attempt to clarify the details of those transactions. In the process, they must strike a balance between clarifying everything or disregarding those aspects of a statement they don’t understand.</p>
            <p>The interface that isn’t working is natural language. Natural human speech is a crappy interface for voice input technologies. The reason is simple: human speech was developed to be understood by another human being. Attempting to get a computer to understand speech at the level of sugar-addled toddler is fiendishly difficult.</p>
            <p>Voice input platforms try to solve this problem by focusing on certain key details called “slots” and clarifying them before moving on to the next key detail. The result is an interaction that has the most superficial form of human speech — alternating interlocutors — without any of the deep structures that makes human speech meaningful or useful. The only context is the assumption that the interaction should end with either a simple command (“Play the Talking Heads”) or a commercial transaction (“Buy Tide detergent.”)<br>
                    The solution to this problem is simple, but remains unacceptable to the companies that build these platforms: abandon natural language.</p>
            <p>Tone communicates a huge amount to human beings. If you have ever listened to people speaking a language you did not understand, you can gain a huge degree of comprehension through tone alone. Guitarists use these quirks of tone in language to make their guitars appear to “speak.” A few notes played in the correct order can handle the simple communications of voice output more efficiently than Alexa’s disturbing absence of vocal affect. Smart speakers attempt to create a rough approximation of the rise and fall of human speech.</p>
            <p>We speak the way dogs sniff at each others nethers. We fill the silence. We reassure. Spoken language is a reflection of our social nature.<br>
                If you want voice input to work really well, you need to remind users that they aren’t using spoken language. They are vocalizing with a purpose. Just like writing is an artificial form, this type of vocalizing needs to be artificial. </p>
            <p>Right now, all of these technologies operate on a similar model to Morse code. The sound is translated into written speech. Morse code is not a language like American Sign Language or French. It is a way of translating the alphabet into easily transmissible sounds or pulses. Similarly, Alexa takes sound waves and attempts to translate their patterns into written language which the system then uses to distill intent and fill slots.</p>

            <h2>Deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>What is deep learning</strong><br>
              Both machine and deep learning are subsets of artificial intelligence, but deep learning represents the next evolution of machine learning. In machine learning, algorithms created by human programmers are responsible for parsing and learning from the data. They make decisions based on what they learn from the data. Deep learning learns through an artificial neural network that acts very much like a human brain and allows the machine to analyze data in a structure very much as humans do. Deep learning machines don't require a human programmer to tell them what to do with the data. This is made possible by the extraordinary amount of data we collect and consume—data is the fuel for deep-learning models.</p>
            <p>10 ways deep learning is used in practice</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>customer experience: </strong> Just a couple of examples include online self-service solutions and to create reliable workflows. There are already deep-learning models being used for chatbots, and as deep learning continues to mature, we can expect this to be an area deep learning will be used for many businesses.</li>
              <li><strong>translation: </strong>Although automatic machine translation isn’t new, deep learning is helping enhance automatic translation of text by using stacked networks of neural networks and allowing translations from images.</li>
              <li><strong>adding color to black-and-white images and videos</strong></li>
              <li><strong>language recognition: </strong>Deep learning machines are beginning to differentiate dialects of a language. A machine decides that someone is speaking English and then engages an AI that is learning to tell the differences between dialects. Once the dialect is determined, another AI will step in that specializes in that particular dialect. All of this happens without involvement from a human.</li>
              <li><strong>autonomous vehicules :</strong>There's not just one AI model at work as an autonomous vehicle drives down the street. Some deep-learning models specialize in streets signs while others are trained to recognize pedestrians. As a car navigates down the road, it can be informed by up to millions of individual AI models that allow the car to act.</li>
              <li><strong>computer vision: </strong>Deep learning has delivered super-human accuracy for image classification, object detection, image restoration and image segmentation—even handwritten digits can be recognized. Deep learning using enormous neural networks is teaching machines to automate the tasks performed by human visual systems.</li>
              <li><strong>text generation: </strong>The machines learn the punctuation, grammar and style of a piece of text and can use the model it developed to automatically create entirely new text with the proper spelling, grammar and style of the example text. Everything from Shakespeare to Wikipedia entries have been created.</li>
              <li><strong>image caption generation: </strong>Another impressive capability of deep learning is to identify an image and create a coherent caption with proper sentence structure for that image just like a human would write.</li>
              <li><strong>news aggregator based on sentiment: </strong>When you want to filter out the negative coming to your world, advanced natural language processing and deep learning can help. News aggregators using this new technology can filter news based on sentiment, so you can create news streams that only cover the good news happening.</li>
              <li><strong>deep learning robots: </strong>Deep-learning applications for robots are plentiful and powerful from an impressive deep-learning system that can teach a robot just by observing the actions of a human completing a task to a housekeeping robot that’s provided with input from several other AIs in order to take action. Just like how a human brain processes input from past experiences, current input from senses and any additional data that is provided, deep-learning models will help robots execute tasks based on the input of many different AI opinions.</li>

                Each difference you see is another artboard from Sketch. I had ~20 screens per app.<br>
                I exported all screens into Principle to quickly create a prototype with smooth transitions between screens. Exported as a .mov file<br>
                Ran the .mov file through HandBrake to reduce the file size. It exports as a .mp4 file<br>
                Brought the .mp4 file into Photoshop and exported as a GIF.<br>
                I ran through some trial and error of the above, and this is the process that produced the best quality of GIFs.<br>

              <li>third party browser extensions like ad blockers</li>

              <li>overload or downtime affecting the server where the resource is found, meaning it fails to respond in time or at all</li>
              <li>corporate firewalls blocking, removing or altering content (large institutions like banks or government departments may use these)</li>
              <li>mobile network providers resampling images and altering content to speed up load times and reduce bandwidth usage</li>

              <li>internet providers inserting their own code into the page that accidentally conflicts with your own</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, some users turn off features in their browsers deliberately - you should respect their decision and make sure they can still use your service.</p>

            <h2>SEO - Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
            <p>Search engines only look at text and words in the html files. They look at the headings and the structures.<br>
                Make sure the title is good and short (in the header). Use the meta tags with: name ="description" content=" what the page is about ..."<br>
                name="keywords" content=" 5 to 7 keywords separated by comas"<br>
                add an alt property to all image of the side that are meaningful to my page.<br>
                &lt;img alt="French fries" src="fries.jpg"/&gt;<br>
                <strong>page ranking:</strong> the more high quality website link to my website makes my ranking go up.<br>
                Then submit the page to search engines.<br>
                Search engine also check site maps. This gives an indications on how often you site changes and google or other search engine might take this into account to check your website.<br>
                Keeping the sitemap updated can be done automatically. (sitemap generator)
