            <h2>Chatbot - Conversation interface - Dialogflow - voice input</h2>
            <p><a href="https://guild.co/blog/five-reasons-why-chatbots-will-transform-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Five reasons why chatbots will transform customer service</strong></a></p>
            <p>Armed with today’s technological advancements, chatbots are much more user friendly and can carry out tasks and answer questions without pre-programming. Users don’t need to know the proper diction and syntax to get the answers they need. They can simply ask a question as they would say them conversationally. And this is why one of the leading use cases for chatbots is in customer service.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>immediate 24/7 coverage: </strong>Chatbots can assist customers immediately without needing to wait on hold or in a queue. </li>
                <li><strong>Better customer engagement: </strong>Most customer-facing bots are programmed to engage in a positive tone while providing exact, concise answers. Bots also address another customer engagement issue pertinent in today’s global marketplace: the language barrier. Chatbots programmed to translate can engage customers who may not speak the same language as the customer service agents</li>
                <li><strong>Serving as a job aid for any employee: </strong>Chatbots synced to internal programs like CRM, ERP or accounting systems can help locate customer information immediately while the agent converses with the customer. This level of convenience can aid nearly any position in a company.Chatbots can serve as a convenient sidekick for seasoned employees while at the same time help less experienced employees feel more confident and competent faster than they would otherwise. Companies can also reduce the amount of time it takes to train new customer service agents when they can get up to speed faster with the aid of a bot.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved work satisfaction: </strong>By allowing chatbots to answer typical high-volume, simple questions, customer service agents will then add more value by taking on mostly complex or personal queries. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/voice-input-the-interface-problem-1700be45ec18" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Voice input: the interface problem</strong></a></p>
            <p>The issue with voice input is not the technology, it’s the interface.<br>
                In these systems, the intent of the spoken command may be high or low utility. The user’s utility doesn’t matter. High utility tasks are focused and specific, while low utility tasks are vague and hard to decipher. The system determines the utility of the user’s words according to its own needs. <br>
                These systems don’t deal in language as most linguists would define it. It’s a false model of language in which each statement should have a logical flow and intent because it serves their purpose in structuring a transaction of goods or information. 
            </p>
            <p>But real people don’t talk that way. This incompatibility between the transactional needs of the systems and the non-logical, unstructured form of human speech leads to errors and misunderstandings. Eliminating error and misunderstanding is the biggest challenge faced by the designers of voice input systems. Companies designing apps for Alexa and her sisters are encouraged to create a strong error strategy — to assume that misunderstanding, lack of understanding, and not hearing are the default outcomes.</p>
            <p>An important aspect of all human conversations is the assumption of shared understanding. People get really angry when they are asked to clarify statements that seem obvious to them.</p>
            <p>Because voice input technologies need all interactions to lead to a transaction, they attempt to clarify the details of those transactions. In the process, they must strike a balance between clarifying everything or disregarding those aspects of a statement they don’t understand.</p>
            <p>The interface that isn’t working is natural language. Natural human speech is a crappy interface for voice input technologies. The reason is simple: human speech was developed to be understood by another human being. Attempting to get a computer to understand speech at the level of sugar-addled toddler is fiendishly difficult.</p>
            <p>Voice input platforms try to solve this problem by focusing on certain key details called “slots” and clarifying them before moving on to the next key detail. The result is an interaction that has the most superficial form of human speech — alternating interlocutors — without any of the deep structures that makes human speech meaningful or useful. The only context is the assumption that the interaction should end with either a simple command (“Play the Talking Heads”) or a commercial transaction (“Buy Tide detergent.”)<br>
                    The solution to this problem is simple, but remains unacceptable to the companies that build these platforms: abandon natural language.</p>
            <p>Tone communicates a huge amount to human beings. If you have ever listened to people speaking a language you did not understand, you can gain a huge degree of comprehension through tone alone. Guitarists use these quirks of tone in language to make their guitars appear to “speak.” A few notes played in the correct order can handle the simple communications of voice output more efficiently than Alexa’s disturbing absence of vocal affect. Smart speakers attempt to create a rough approximation of the rise and fall of human speech.</p>
            <p>We speak the way dogs sniff at each others nethers. We fill the silence. We reassure. Spoken language is a reflection of our social nature.<br>
                If you want voice input to work really well, you need to remind users that they aren’t using spoken language. They are vocalizing with a purpose. Just like writing is an artificial form, this type of vocalizing needs to be artificial. </p>
            <p>Right now, all of these technologies operate on a similar model to Morse code. The sound is translated into written speech. Morse code is not a language like American Sign Language or French. It is a way of translating the alphabet into easily transmissible sounds or pulses. Similarly, Alexa takes sound waves and attempts to translate their patterns into written language which the system then uses to distill intent and fill slots.</p>

            <p>How to make animated GIF to show the different UX layers<br>
                Each difference you see is another artboard from Sketch. I had ~20 screens per app.<br>
                I exported all screens into Principle to quickly create a prototype with smooth transitions between screens. Exported as a .mov file<br>
                Ran the .mov file through HandBrake to reduce the file size. It exports as a .mp4 file<br>
                Brought the .mp4 file into Photoshop and exported as a GIF.<br>
                I ran through some trial and error of the above, and this is the process that produced the best quality of GIFs.<br>
                <br>
                Another possibility:<br>
                Sketch & Principle for mac + Invision-Studio + Adobe Photoshop

            <p>Don’t assume users turn off JavaScript<br>
                You shouldn’t assume the reason for designing a site that works without CSS or JavaScript (or anything else) is because a user chooses to switch these off.
                </p>
            <p>There are many situations when extra layers can fail to load or are filtered. This can happen due to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>temporary network errors</li>
              <li>third party browser extensions like ad blockers</li>
              <li>DNS lookup failures</li>
              <li>overload or downtime affecting the server where the resource is found, meaning it fails to respond in time or at all</li>
              <li>corporate firewalls blocking, removing or altering content (large institutions like banks or government departments may use these)</li>
              <li>mobile network providers resampling images and altering content to speed up load times and reduce bandwidth usage</li>
              <li>personal firewalls or antivirus software altering or blocking content</li>
              <li>internet providers inserting their own code into the page that accidentally conflicts with your own</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, some users turn off features in their browsers deliberately - you should respect their decision and make sure they can still use your service.</p>

            <p>Search engines only look at text and words in the html files. They look at the headings and the structures.<br>
                Make sure the title is good and short (in the header). Use the meta tags with: name ="description" content=" what the page is about ..."<br>
                name="keywords" content=" 5 to 7 keywords separated by comas"<br>
                add an alt property to all image of the side that are meaningful to my page.<br>
                &lt;img alt="French fries" src="fries.jpg"/&gt;<br>
                <strong>page ranking:</strong> the more high quality website link to my website makes my ranking go up.<br>
                Then submit the page to search engines.<br>
                Search engine also check site maps. This gives an indications on how often you site changes and google or other search engine might take this into account to check your website.<br>
                Keeping the sitemap updated can be done automatically. (sitemap generator)
