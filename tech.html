            <h2>AWS - Amazon Web Services</h2>
            <p>Netflix for example depends on it. Companies turn to AWS because of cost and scalability. You only pay for what you use.It also reduces latency as you can get your server closer to your user simple because they have the highest number of servers.</p>
            <p>Microsof Azure is the biggest competitor and started providing cloud services around 2010</p>
            <p>Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) is one of the core service of AWS</p>

            <p>Instances running computing operations can increase or decrease at will, you can also have more or less storage with elastic block storage.</p>
            <p>Simple Storage Services (S3) stores files, the maximum file size is 5 terabyte .</p>
            <p>Relational Database Service (RDS) - AWS handles everything for you, including their security</p>

            <h2>Chatbot - Conversation interface - Dialogflow - voice input</h2>
            <p><a href="https://guild.co/blog/five-reasons-why-chatbots-will-transform-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Five reasons why chatbots will transform customer service</strong></a></p>
            <p>Armed with today’s technological advancements, chatbots are much more user friendly and can carry out tasks and answer questions without pre-programming. Users don’t need to know the proper diction and syntax to get the answers they need. They can simply ask a question as they would say them conversationally. And this is why one of the leading use cases for chatbots is in customer service.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>immediate 24/7 coverage: </strong>Chatbots can assist customers immediately without needing to wait on hold or in a queue. </li>
                <li><strong>Better customer engagement: </strong>Most customer-facing bots are programmed to engage in a positive tone while providing exact, concise answers. Bots also address another customer engagement issue pertinent in today’s global marketplace: the language barrier. Chatbots programmed to translate can engage customers who may not speak the same language as the customer service agents</li>
                <li><strong>Serving as a job aid for any employee: </strong>Chatbots synced to internal programs like CRM, ERP or accounting systems can help locate customer information immediately while the agent converses with the customer. This level of convenience can aid nearly any position in a company.Chatbots can serve as a convenient sidekick for seasoned employees while at the same time help less experienced employees feel more confident and competent faster than they would otherwise. Companies can also reduce the amount of time it takes to train new customer service agents when they can get up to speed faster with the aid of a bot.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved work satisfaction: </strong>By allowing chatbots to answer typical high-volume, simple questions, customer service agents will then add more value by taking on mostly complex or personal queries. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/voice-input-the-interface-problem-1700be45ec18" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Voice input: the interface problem</strong></a></p>
            <p>The issue with voice input is not the technology, it’s the interface.<br>
                In these systems, the intent of the spoken command may be high or low utility. The user’s utility doesn’t matter. High utility tasks are focused and specific, while low utility tasks are vague and hard to decipher. The system determines the utility of the user’s words according to its own needs. <br>
                These systems don’t deal in language as most linguists would define it. It’s a false model of language in which each statement should have a logical flow and intent because it serves their purpose in structuring a transaction of goods or information. 
            </p>
            <p>But real people don’t talk that way. This incompatibility between the transactional needs of the systems and the non-logical, unstructured form of human speech leads to errors and misunderstandings. Eliminating error and misunderstanding is the biggest challenge faced by the designers of voice input systems. Companies designing apps for Alexa and her sisters are encouraged to create a strong error strategy — to assume that misunderstanding, lack of understanding, and not hearing are the default outcomes.</p>
            <p>An important aspect of all human conversations is the assumption of shared understanding. People get really angry when they are asked to clarify statements that seem obvious to them.</p>
            <p>Because voice input technologies need all interactions to lead to a transaction, they attempt to clarify the details of those transactions. In the process, they must strike a balance between clarifying everything or disregarding those aspects of a statement they don’t understand.</p>
            <p>The interface that isn’t working is natural language. Natural human speech is a crappy interface for voice input technologies. The reason is simple: human speech was developed to be understood by another human being. Attempting to get a computer to understand speech at the level of sugar-addled toddler is fiendishly difficult.</p>
            <p>Voice input platforms try to solve this problem by focusing on certain key details called “slots” and clarifying them before moving on to the next key detail. The result is an interaction that has the most superficial form of human speech — alternating interlocutors — without any of the deep structures that makes human speech meaningful or useful. The only context is the assumption that the interaction should end with either a simple command (“Play the Talking Heads”) or a commercial transaction (“Buy Tide detergent.”)<br>
                    The solution to this problem is simple, but remains unacceptable to the companies that build these platforms: abandon natural language.</p>
            <p>Tone communicates a huge amount to human beings. If you have ever listened to people speaking a language you did not understand, you can gain a huge degree of comprehension through tone alone. Guitarists use these quirks of tone in language to make their guitars appear to “speak.” A few notes played in the correct order can handle the simple communications of voice output more efficiently than Alexa’s disturbing absence of vocal affect. Smart speakers attempt to create a rough approximation of the rise and fall of human speech.</p>
            <p>We speak the way dogs sniff at each others nethers. We fill the silence. We reassure. Spoken language is a reflection of our social nature.<br>
                If you want voice input to work really well, you need to remind users that they aren’t using spoken language. They are vocalizing with a purpose. Just like writing is an artificial form, this type of vocalizing needs to be artificial. </p>
            <p>Right now, all of these technologies operate on a similar model to Morse code. The sound is translated into written speech. Morse code is not a language like American Sign Language or French. It is a way of translating the alphabet into easily transmissible sounds or pulses. Similarly, Alexa takes sound waves and attempts to translate their patterns into written language which the system then uses to distill intent and fill slots.</p>

            <h2>Deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>What is deep learning</strong><br>
              Both machine and deep learning are subsets of artificial intelligence, but deep learning represents the next evolution of machine learning. In machine learning, algorithms created by human programmers are responsible for parsing and learning from the data. They make decisions based on what they learn from the data. Deep learning learns through an artificial neural network that acts very much like a human brain and allows the machine to analyze data in a structure very much as humans do. Deep learning machines don't require a human programmer to tell them what to do with the data. This is made possible by the extraordinary amount of data we collect and consume—data is the fuel for deep-learning models.</p>
            <p>10 ways deep learning is used in practice</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>customer experience: </strong> Just a couple of examples include online self-service solutions and to create reliable workflows. There are already deep-learning models being used for chatbots, and as deep learning continues to mature, we can expect this to be an area deep learning will be used for many businesses.</li>
              <li><strong>translation: </strong>Although automatic machine translation isn’t new, deep learning is helping enhance automatic translation of text by using stacked networks of neural networks and allowing translations from images.</li>
              <li><strong>adding color to black-and-white images and videos</strong></li>
              <li><strong>language recognition: </strong>Deep learning machines are beginning to differentiate dialects of a language. A machine decides that someone is speaking English and then engages an AI that is learning to tell the differences between dialects. Once the dialect is determined, another AI will step in that specializes in that particular dialect. All of this happens without involvement from a human.</li>
              <li><strong>autonomous vehicules :</strong>There's not just one AI model at work as an autonomous vehicle drives down the street. Some deep-learning models specialize in streets signs while others are trained to recognize pedestrians. As a car navigates down the road, it can be informed by up to millions of individual AI models that allow the car to act.</li>
              <li><strong>computer vision: </strong>Deep learning has delivered super-human accuracy for image classification, object detection, image restoration and image segmentation—even handwritten digits can be recognized. Deep learning using enormous neural networks is teaching machines to automate the tasks performed by human visual systems.</li>
              <li><strong>text generation: </strong>The machines learn the punctuation, grammar and style of a piece of text and can use the model it developed to automatically create entirely new text with the proper spelling, grammar and style of the example text. Everything from Shakespeare to Wikipedia entries have been created.</li>
              <li><strong>image caption generation: </strong>Another impressive capability of deep learning is to identify an image and create a coherent caption with proper sentence structure for that image just like a human would write.</li>
              <li><strong>news aggregator based on sentiment: </strong>When you want to filter out the negative coming to your world, advanced natural language processing and deep learning can help. News aggregators using this new technology can filter news based on sentiment, so you can create news streams that only cover the good news happening.</li>
              <li><strong>deep learning robots: </strong>Deep-learning applications for robots are plentiful and powerful from an impressive deep-learning system that can teach a robot just by observing the actions of a human completing a task to a housekeeping robot that’s provided with input from several other AIs in order to take action. Just like how a human brain processes input from past experiences, current input from senses and any additional data that is provided, deep-learning models will help robots execute tasks based on the input of many different AI opinions.</li>

            <p><strong>Digitisation</strong>: Digitization refers to creating a digital representations of physical objects. In other words, digitization is about converting something non-digital into a digital representation or artefact.</p>
            <p><strong>Digitalisation</strong>: Digitalization refers to enabling, improving or transforming business process by leveraging digital technologies (e.g., APIs) and digitized data. That means that digitalisation presumes digitization.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital Transformation</strong>: Digital transformation is the profound transformation of business activities, competencies, and business models to fully leverage the opportunities of digital technologies.</p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/digitalisation.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/digitalisation.png"/></a></p>
            <p><strong>Paradigm of Change model</strong>: an organisation can be described with the following three components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>strategy (What-Should-Be)</strong>: strategy describes what an organisation wants to accomplish. In other words, where the company should be. Strategy is transformational.</li>
                <li><strong>tactics (What-Will-Be)</strong>: tactics describes how the organisation is accomplishing the goal. In other words, what the company will do. Tactics is transitional.</li>
                <li><strong>operations (What-Is)</strong>: operations describes what an organisation is doing. In other words, what the company is right now. Operations is traditional.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Strategy, tactics, and operations are the components that describe the constant fluctuations of an organisation.</p>
            <p>The three components are depicted as Venn diagram in the following figure. As you see, they overlap. The intersection of strategy/tactics, strategy/operations, and tactics/operations is where the real power of APIs are.</p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/critical-design-thinking.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/critical-design-thinking.png"/></a></p>
            <p>It’s important to standardise processes to optimise them with respect to time, cost, and quality. When you standardise processes, you can define meaningful metrics, start measuring, and monitor KPIs.<br>
                Naturally, every organisation runs into business problems, which needs to be solved. To this goal, organisations typically apply <strong>critical thinking</strong> to solve business problems.<br>
                <strong>Critical thinking is the objective analysis of facts to form a judgement</strong><br>
                Hence, critical thinking is appropriate to solve business processes because you can analyse them and evaluate KPIs to make fact-based decision about what to improve or change.
            </p>
            <p><strong>An API solution</strong> consists of one or several APIs that solve an integration problem. More specifically, an API solution is an integration solution between computer systems to enable inter-communication.</p>
            <p>API solutions prospers within operations or the What-Is. The reasons are that the problems to solve are precise and the outcome measurable. Typical problems are integration of two computer systems or automation of business process X to improve speed and reduce costs.</p>
            <p>An API solution enables the automation of the interaction between computer systems. Automation may reduce significantly manual efforts and thus making processes cheaper and faster. Automation requires standardisation, which fosters higher quality.</p>
            <p><strong>An API product</strong> consists of one or several APIs that provide an interface to a value proposition. In other words, an API product consists of value proposition interfaces or rather VPIs. In contrast, API solutions consists of API, which don’t provide an interface to a value proposition. The value proposition of API solutions is creating the communication link between computer systems.</p>
            <p>API products help customers getting the job done. To this goal, API products address customer pains and offer gains. API products have a business model and thus creating value for both the organisation and its customers.<br>
                API products prospers within tactics or the What-Will-Be. The reasons are that the problems to solve are precise and the outcome measurable. Typical goal is to explore and find new business models thus, impacting the strategy it self. This is digital transformation in its core.

                Each difference you see is another artboard from Sketch. I had ~20 screens per app.<br>
                I exported all screens into Principle to quickly create a prototype with smooth transitions between screens. Exported as a .mov file<br>
                Ran the .mov file through HandBrake to reduce the file size. It exports as a .mp4 file<br>
                Brought the .mp4 file into Photoshop and exported as a GIF.<br>
                I ran through some trial and error of the above, and this is the process that produced the best quality of GIFs.<br>

            <h2>Heroku</h2>
            <p>Heroku is a platform as a service PaaS, build on Amazon Web Services (AWS). A wide variety of buildpacks are available depending on the language you are using and the version of that language.If your language is not available, you have the option to build your own buildpack.<br>
            On the resources tab from the dashboard you can add adds-on. From the config tab, you have a maintenance screen set up.</p>

            <p>Organisations use <strong>Business Process Modeling (BP Modeling)</strong> in order to visually document, understand, and improve their processes. A part of <strong>Business Process Management (BPM)</strong>, 
                BP Modeling has been used as an organisational tool to <strong>map out what is (or “as-is”) as a baseline</strong> and to <strong>determine the future (or “to-be”) with any improvements assimilated</strong>. BP Modeling visually represents all of the connecting activities, events, and resources of the process of a product or service to make it more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>Process modeling often uses <strong>Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)</strong>, a standard method of illustrating processes with flowchart-like diagrams that can be easily understood by both IT and business managers.</p>
            <p>Reasons to use BP Modeling are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>to create visual models of processes</strong> - Word-driven documentation is often not sufficient for employees to understand the way a process is performed. Backing it up with visual representations helps provide a comprehensive picture</li>
                <li><strong>align operations</strong> - With any new business strategy, keeping processes consistent after a change requires figuring out how to stay within the overall organizational strategy. Analyses are also performed to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and enable process agility</li>
                <li><strong>improve process communication </strong>- Communication is the key to all of the following tasks: formalizing existing processes (that were once informal knowledge), making consistent processes, eliminating guesswork with business rules, handling exceptions, providing regulatory compliance, ensuring business people are in charge, and supporting new initiatives</li>
                <li><strong>improve operational efficiency </strong>- Modeling processes promotes optimization by allowing simulation and illustrating needed improvements. This reduces cycle time and promotes better resource utilisation</li>
                <li><strong>gain competitive advantage </strong>- A process is better overall when it is constantly refined and aligned with its business’ strategies. This efficiency places the company in a forward-leaning position to be better than the competition</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In today's digital world, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) generally refers to a new and alternative way of accessing software, as opposed to more traditional methods of access.  </p>
            <p>Whereas in the past software would generally be purchased outright and loaded onto a device, SaaS normally refers to a subscription based model where the software is hosted in the cloud and accessed via the internet. There are a number of benefits of this to consumers, whether that is individuals using software for private purposes, or businesses.</p>
            <p>There are many well-known examples of SaaS, including Office 365, Google Apps, Salesforce, Citrix GoToMeeting, Cisco WebEx and Netflix. </p>
            <p>Examples of where SaaS can be used by enterprises:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>accounting and invoicing</li>
                <li>tracking sales</li>
                <li>planning</li>
                <li>performance monitoring </li>
                <li>communications (including webmail and messaging)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">Traditional software vs. Software as a Service</p>
            <p>Traditional software</p>
            <ul>
                <li>users purchase the software upfront as a package and then install it onto their computer</li>
                <li>licences may be limited to the number of users and/or devices where the software can be deployed </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Software as a Service</p>
            <ul>
                <li>users subscribe to the software, usually on a monthly basis, rather than purchase it, meaning no upfront costs</li>
                <li>users can usually end their subscription when they no longer require it</li>
                <li>applications are updated and used online with files saved in the cloud rather than on individual computers</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">Benefits of SaaS</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>no hardware costs</strong>: Processing power is supplied by the cloud provider</li>
                <li><strong>no initial setup costs</strong>: Applications are ready to use once the user subscribes</li>
                <li><strong>pay for what you use</strong>: Particularly beneficial when something is only required for a short period</li>
                <li><strong>usage is scalable</strong>: Additional storage or services can be accessed on demand without needing to install new software and hardware</li>
                <li><strong>update are automatic</strong>: Updates are often free of change and deployed automatically by the software provider</li>
                <li><strong>cross device compatibility</strong>: Applications can be accessed via any internet enabled device, such as desktops, smart phones and tablets</li>
                <li><strong>accessible from any location</strong>: Users aren’t restricted to one location and can access applications from any internet enabled device</li>
                <li><strong>applications can be customised and white labelled</strong>: Applications can often be altered to suit the needs and branding of particular customers</li>
            </ul>

            <p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-strategy-bcaa3fda9a31" class="other" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WTF is Strategy?</strong></a></p>
            <p><strong>The framework: </strong>before we talk about strategy, it needs to be contextualized within a few other concepts primarily because strategy never exists (or shouldn’t exist) in isolation. Here are the high-level definitions of the different components from a product-centric view:</p>
            <uL>
                <li><strong>Mission:</strong> This is a statement that describes the problem you are setting out to solve, typically including who you are solving it for. This is often set at the company level, but can also be defined for a product or product line.</li>
                <li><strong>Vision:</strong> This is the idealized solution that addresses the problem you’ve articulated in your mission. A product vision typically has just enough viability to be relatable, but is still devoid of the details that may hamper your imagination. Product vision is also the goal post and rallying point for your product — it paints the picture of how your product will make an impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a set of principles and decisions — informed by reality (e.g. market forces, laws of physics, data) and caveated with assumptions — that you commit to ahead of development to ensure the greatest likelihood of success in achieving your vision. Your strategy may evolve with the introduction of new data. If there’s a big shift in strategy while the mission and vision remain constant, it’s called a <strong>pivot</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Roadmap:</strong> This is the manifestation of your strategy in concrete steps towards your product vision, inclusive of rough milestones and timelines. This, too, often changes given new data. (As I like to say, a roadmap is defunct as soon as it’s published.)</li>
                <li><strong>Execution:</strong> This is the day-to-day activities along the path of the roadmap. This is where you do the hard work to build, launch, and iterate, all the while collecting the necessary data to inform any changes in your roadmap and strategy.</li>
            </uL>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/strategy1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-third-width" src="assets/images/tech/strategy1.png"/></a></p>
            <p>As the gradient and size of the diagram above suggests, the mission, by design, is both vague and broad. The further down you go in the stack, the more concrete and narrow these concepts become.</p>
            <p>Strategy within this framework bridges the gap between <strong>what you aspire to be</strong> and <strong>what you are doing.</strong></p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/strategy2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/strategy2.png"/></a></p>
            <p>In other words, <strong>strategy represents the set of guiding principles for your roadmapping and execution tasks to ensure they align with your mission and vision.</strong></p>
