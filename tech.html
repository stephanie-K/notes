            <h2>AWS - Amazon Web Services</h2>
            <p>Netflix for example depends on it. Companies turn to AWS because of cost and scalability. You only pay for what you use.It also reduces latency as you can get your server closer to your user simple because they have the highest number of servers.</p>
            <p>Microsof Azure is the biggest competitor and started providing cloud services around 2010</p>
            <p>Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) is one of the core service of AWS</p>

            <p>Instances running computing operations can increase or decrease at will, you can also have more or less storage with elastic block storage.</p>
            <p>Simple Storage Services (S3) stores files, the maximum file size is 5 terabyte .</p>
            <p>Relational Database Service (RDS) - AWS handles everything for you, including their security</p>

            <p>Armed with today’s technological advancements, chatbots are much more user friendly and can carry out tasks and answer questions without pre-programming. Users don’t need to know the proper diction and syntax to get the answers they need. They can simply ask a question as they would say them conversationally. And this is why one of the leading use cases for chatbots is in customer service.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>immediate 24/7 coverage: </strong>Chatbots can assist customers immediately without needing to wait on hold or in a queue. </li>
                <li><strong>Better customer engagement: </strong>Most customer-facing bots are programmed to engage in a positive tone while providing exact, concise answers. Bots also address another customer engagement issue pertinent in today’s global marketplace: the language barrier. Chatbots programmed to translate can engage customers who may not speak the same language as the customer service agents</li>
                <li><strong>Serving as a job aid for any employee: </strong>Chatbots synced to internal programs like CRM, ERP or accounting systems can help locate customer information immediately while the agent converses with the customer. This level of convenience can aid nearly any position in a company.Chatbots can serve as a convenient sidekick for seasoned employees while at the same time help less experienced employees feel more confident and competent faster than they would otherwise. Companies can also reduce the amount of time it takes to train new customer service agents when they can get up to speed faster with the aid of a bot.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved work satisfaction: </strong>By allowing chatbots to answer typical high-volume, simple questions, customer service agents will then add more value by taking on mostly complex or personal queries. </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>A chatbot </strong>is a program that can conduct an intelligent conversation. Convincingly simulate human behaviour and pass the Turing test.</p>
            <p>2 sorts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rule based:</strong> basic, know only about rules that have been pre-programmed</li>
                <li><strong>AI based:</strong> intelligent, learns from conversations using ML techniques. For this one, it implies: machine learning - learn from previous conversations - uses voice recognition if it's voice bot rather than a chatbot, and natural language recognition to understand what the user is trying to convey</li>

            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/chat2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-half-width" src="assets/images/tech/chat2.png"/></a></p>
            <p><strong>User expression</strong> = conversation snippets that a user might use to ask the bot questions<br>
                the bot maps the user request to an intent<br>
                the intent determines the action taken by code<br>
                the code executes to fulfil the intent of the user<br>
                the response in the form of a text message is sent back to the user
            </p>
            <p>
                Agent translates user requests to actionable data (i.e. intents)<br> 
                Entities help extract information from user speech with the help of prompts<br>
                User expression s are annotated to specify parameters which customise queries<br>
                Smalltalk helps make bots friendly and chatty with no additional code  
            </p>
            <p><strong>Agents</strong> manage conversation flow with the user using intents, entities, contexts and other building blocks</p>
            <p><strong>Intents</strong> are configured by developers and used to determine the action taken by code. An intent maps what a user says and what your software should execute.</p>
            <p><strong>Default intents:</strong><br>
                Welcome (greet the user, exchange pleasantries (partially configured))<br>
                Fallback (dault or fall through intent when no others match (fully configured))
            </p>
            <p><strong>Intent sections:</strong> user says / action / response / context</p>
            <p><strong>Custom intents</strong> example: book a table, book a flight, book car, book room</p>
            <p><strong>Entities:</strong> all the information we need in a user query will have a corresponding entity =<br>
                slots to be filled (city, date, room, etc... some could be mandatory or optional)<br>
                3 types:  system entities, developer entities, and user entities (these last one are defined by session and per user).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Single intent linear dialog:</strong><br>
                Collect information required to complete the action -  may invoke one or more intent<br>
                <strong>Multiple intent:</strong><br>
                 we might want the context of an intent to be passed on to the other intent (like date and destination)
            </p>
            <p class="lead">How to design one</p>
            <p><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/conversational-interface-for-chatbot-voicebot-the-french-touch-28a1d5522ec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Conversational interface for chatbot & voicebot: the French touch</strong></a></p>
            <p>After the user research phase, <strong>I design the “happy path”</strong>, i.e. the conversation when everything is going well, then the other cases (e.g. the user says “I don’t know” or “no”, etc.). Finally, I have to focus on <strong>“repair conversations”</strong> which is equivalent to the error messages and redirections on a website.</p>
            <p>A huge part of the work is to analyse and identify contexts in order to adapt the design to typical conversations in a given setting. <strong>I use macrographs to represent the whole user experience</strong>, which gives an immediate overview of the project and also helps to define product scope and goals. <strong>The other main specific deliverables are Context map, Intelligence rules and Dialog flows</strong>. The more you anticipate specific cases, the better the experience will be. In particular, we <strong>pay great attention to non-response scenarios</strong>.</p>
            <p>Finally, I also include a plan to <strong>measure success (KPIs)</strong>, including giving users the opportunity to say if they are pleased with their experience via pre-set answer suggestions (“Thanks”, “Great!”).</p>
            <p><strong>What advice would you give to UX designers, who want enter this field?</strong><br>
                First of all, do not change the classic design approach! Like in any project, do a lot of co-design workshops with your client to <strong>define your persona bot, identify and prioritize your goals, and choose your wording very carefully</strong>.<br>
                Above all, <strong>test and test again</strong>, I will never stop repeating that. Your creation is worthless if it hasn’t been tested on real end-users. Feedback from user testing is essential and irreplaceable: “I never have a problem buying my ticket, the problem is finding the train”, “I had to interrupt the bot to give it more medical information”, “I feel I am forced to choose from only a small range of products. I want to have more choice”. You never know in advance if you are going to have to change your project strategy at any given time.<br>
                Don’t hesitate to <strong>invite your client to assist in test sessions</strong>. In my experience, a “Wizard of Oz” method of VUX (Voice User Experience) testing thrilled a lot of my clients because they could see how their product could be used by the users once developed.

            <h2>Deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>What is deep learning</strong><br>
              Both machine and deep learning are subsets of artificial intelligence, but deep learning represents the next evolution of machine learning. In machine learning, algorithms created by human programmers are responsible for parsing and learning from the data. They make decisions based on what they learn from the data. Deep learning learns through an artificial neural network that acts very much like a human brain and allows the machine to analyze data in a structure very much as humans do. Deep learning machines don't require a human programmer to tell them what to do with the data. This is made possible by the extraordinary amount of data we collect and consume—data is the fuel for deep-learning models.</p>
            <p>10 ways deep learning is used in practice</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>customer experience: </strong> Just a couple of examples include online self-service solutions and to create reliable workflows. There are already deep-learning models being used for chatbots, and as deep learning continues to mature, we can expect this to be an area deep learning will be used for many businesses.</li>
              <li><strong>translation: </strong>Although automatic machine translation isn’t new, deep learning is helping enhance automatic translation of text by using stacked networks of neural networks and allowing translations from images.</li>
              <li><strong>adding color to black-and-white images and videos</strong></li>
              <li><strong>language recognition: </strong>Deep learning machines are beginning to differentiate dialects of a language. A machine decides that someone is speaking English and then engages an AI that is learning to tell the differences between dialects. Once the dialect is determined, another AI will step in that specializes in that particular dialect. All of this happens without involvement from a human.</li>
              <li><strong>autonomous vehicules :</strong>There's not just one AI model at work as an autonomous vehicle drives down the street. Some deep-learning models specialize in streets signs while others are trained to recognize pedestrians. As a car navigates down the road, it can be informed by up to millions of individual AI models that allow the car to act.</li>
              <li><strong>computer vision: </strong>Deep learning has delivered super-human accuracy for image classification, object detection, image restoration and image segmentation—even handwritten digits can be recognized. Deep learning using enormous neural networks is teaching machines to automate the tasks performed by human visual systems.</li>
              <li><strong>text generation: </strong>The machines learn the punctuation, grammar and style of a piece of text and can use the model it developed to automatically create entirely new text with the proper spelling, grammar and style of the example text. Everything from Shakespeare to Wikipedia entries have been created.</li>
              <li><strong>image caption generation: </strong>Another impressive capability of deep learning is to identify an image and create a coherent caption with proper sentence structure for that image just like a human would write.</li>
              <li><strong>news aggregator based on sentiment: </strong>When you want to filter out the negative coming to your world, advanced natural language processing and deep learning can help. News aggregators using this new technology can filter news based on sentiment, so you can create news streams that only cover the good news happening.</li>
              <li><strong>deep learning robots: </strong>Deep-learning applications for robots are plentiful and powerful from an impressive deep-learning system that can teach a robot just by observing the actions of a human completing a task to a housekeeping robot that’s provided with input from several other AIs in order to take action. Just like how a human brain processes input from past experiences, current input from senses and any additional data that is provided, deep-learning models will help robots execute tasks based on the input of many different AI opinions.</li>

                Each difference you see is another artboard from Sketch. I had ~20 screens per app.<br>
                I exported all screens into Principle to quickly create a prototype with smooth transitions between screens. Exported as a .mov file<br>
                Ran the .mov file through HandBrake to reduce the file size. It exports as a .mp4 file<br>
                Brought the .mp4 file into Photoshop and exported as a GIF.<br>

            <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
            <p><a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Learn analytics with free online courses</strong></a></p>
            <p><a href="https://resources.mygov.scot/guidelines/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOV.SCOT Performance reporting: web analytics setup</strong></a></p>
            <p>Google Analytics is a platform that collects data and compiles it into useful reports.</p>
            <p><strong>Tracking a Website</strong><br>
                To track a website, you first have to create a Google Analytics account. Then you need to <strong>add a small piece of Javascript tracking code to each page on your site immediately after the opening &lt;head&gt; tag</strong>. Every time a user visits a webpage, the tracking code will collect anonymous information about how that user interacted with the page.
            </p>
            <p>Keep in mind that every time a page loads, the tracking code will collect and send updated information about the user’s activity. Google Analytics groups this activity into a period of time called a “session.” 
                <strong>A session begins when a user navigates to a page that includes the Google Analytics tracking code</strong>. A session ends after 30 minutes of inactivity. If the user returns to a page after a session ends, a new session will begin.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-top-2"><strong>Processing and Reporting</strong><br>
                When the tracking code collects data, it packages that information up and sends it to Google Analytics to be processed into reports. 
                When Analytics processes data, it aggregates and organizes the data based on particular criteria like whether a user’s device is mobile or desktop, or which browser they’re using.<br>                    
                But there are also configuration settings that allow you to customize how that data is processed. For example, <strong>you might want to apply a filter</strong> to make sure your data doesn’t include any internal company traffic, or only includes data from a particular country or region that’s important to your business.
            </p>
            <p><span class="red">Once Analytics processes the data, it’s stored in a database where it can’t be changed</span>. So remember, when you set up your configuration, don’t exclude any data you think you might want to analyse later. Once the data has been processed and stored in the database, it will appear in Google Analytics as reports.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-2">
                <strong>The Analytics account structure</strong><br>
                All of your Google Analytics accounts can be grouped under an “Organization,” which is optional. This allows you to manage multiple Google Analytics accounts under one grouping.
            </p>
            <p><a href="assets/images/tech/GA-account-structure.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class ="img-one-quarter-width" src="assets/images/tech/GA-account-structure.png"/></a></p>
            <p>When you create <strong>an account,</strong> you also automatically create an account,<strong>an account,</strong>and, within that property, <strong>a view </strong>for that account. But each Analytics account can have multiple properties and each property can have multiple views.</p>
            <p>Each Google Analytics account has at least one “property.” <strong>Each property can collect data independently of each other</strong> using a unique tracking ID that appears in your tracking code.<br>
                You may assign multiple properties to each account, so you can collect data from different websites, mobile applications, or other digital assets associated with your business.
            </p>
            <p>Just as each account can have multiple “properties,” each property can have multiple “views.” <strong>You can use a feature called Filters in your configuration settings to determine what data you want to include in the reports for each view.</strong></p>
            <p>The view level also lets you set Google Analytics <strong>“Goals”</strong>. Goals are a valuable way to track conversions, or business objectives, from your website. A goal could be how many users signed up for an email newsletter, or how many users purchased a product.</p>
            <p><strong>Important things to note about views: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>new views only include data from the date the view was created and onwards. When you create a new view, it will not include past data</li>
                <li>if you delete a view, only administrators can recover that view within a limited amount of time (35 days). Otherwise, the view will be permanently deleted</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>User Permissions</strong><br>
                You can assign permissions to other users at the account, property, or view level. Each level inherits permissions from the level above it.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-top-2">By clicking “Admin”, Google Analytics lets you set user permissions for: “managing users,” “edit,” “collaborate,” or “read and analyze”:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Managing users” lets users add or remove user access to the account, property, or view</li>
                <li>“Edit” lets users make changes to the configuration settings</li>
                <li>“Collaborate” allows users to share things like dashboards or certain measurement settings</li>
                <li>“Read and Analyze” lets users view data, analyze reports, and create dashboards, but restricts them from making changes to the settings or adding new users</li>    
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-2"><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6382981?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to set up account views with filters</a></p>
            <p>Analytics automatically sets up an unfiltered view called “All Web Site Data.” This contains all of the raw, unchanged data you collected for the property. We recommend changing the name to “Raw data,” so you’ll know that the data hasn’t been filtered. </p>
            <p>Note that if you apply multiple filters to a view, each filter will be applied in the order they appear in your filter settings. So if you have two filters, the data will pass through the first filter before passing through the second. So be mindful of the order in which you apply your filters.</p>

            <p>Don’t assume users turn off JavaScript<br>
                You shouldn’t assume the reason for designing a site that works without CSS or JavaScript (or anything else) is because a user chooses to switch these off.
                </p>
            <p>There are many situations when extra layers can fail to load or are filtered. This can happen due to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>temporary network errors</li>
              <li>third party browser extensions like ad blockers</li>
              <li>DNS lookup failures</li>
              <li>overload or downtime affecting the server where the resource is found, meaning it fails to respond in time or at all</li>
              <li>corporate firewalls blocking, removing or altering content (large institutions like banks or government departments may use these)</li>
              <li>mobile network providers resampling images and altering content to speed up load times and reduce bandwidth usage</li>
              <li>personal firewalls or antivirus software altering or blocking content</li>
              <li>internet providers inserting their own code into the page that accidentally conflicts with your own</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, some users turn off features in their browsers deliberately - you should respect their decision and make sure they can still use your service.</p>

            <p>It’s important to understand that it’s often not the conscious choice of users to arrive at your site without JavaScript. We did some research and discovered that<strong> 0.9% GOV.UK visits are by people who don’t have JavaScript available and haven’t chosen to turn it off</strong>. Stuart Langridge gave an excellent explanation of the many ways your JavaScript can fail to run. A non-exhaustive list includes the:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>script hasn’t finished loading, or has stalled and failed to load completely</li>
                    <li>application route is up, but the route to the Content Delivery Network is broken</li>
                    <li>user has chosen to install a plugin that interferes with the Document Object Model (DOM)</li>
                    <li>user has been infected with a plugin that interferes with the DOM</li>
                    <li>user’s company has a proxy that blocks some or all JavaScript</li>
                    <li>user’s hotel is intercepting the connection and injecting broken JavaScript</li>
                    <li>user’s telecoms provider is intercepting the connection and injecting broken JavaScript</li>
                    <li>user’s country is intercepting the connection and injecting broken JavaScript</li>
                    <li>JavaScript code has functions not implemented by your user’s browser (older browsers, proxy browsers)</li>

            <p>Deep Learning is a little bit over-hyped at the moment and the expectations exceed what can be really done with it right now. But that doesn’t mean it is not useful. I think we live in a Machine Learning renaissance because it gets more and more democratized which enables more and more people to build useful products with it. Out there are a lot of problems that can be solved with Machine Learning and I am sure this will happen in the next few years.<br>
            One of the major problems is that only a few people understand what can be really done with it and know how to build successful Data Science teams that bring real value to a company. On one hand, we have PhD-level engineers that are geniuses in regards to the theory behind Machine Learning but lack an understanding of the business side. And on the other hand, we have CEO’s and people in management positions that have no idea what can be really done with Deep Learning and think that it will solve all of the world’s problems in the next years to come. In my opinion, we need more people that bridge this gap, which will result in more products that are useful for our society.</p>

            <p>In today's digital world, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) generally refers to a new and alternative way of accessing software, as opposed to more traditional methods of access.  </p>
            <p>Whereas in the past software would generally be purchased outright and loaded onto a device, SaaS normally refers to a subscription based model where the software is hosted in the cloud and accessed via the internet. There are a number of benefits of this to consumers, whether that is individuals using software for private purposes, or businesses.</p>
            <p>There are many well-known examples of SaaS, including Office 365, Google Apps, Salesforce, Citrix GoToMeeting, Cisco WebEx and Netflix. </p>
            <p>Examples of where SaaS can be used by enterprises:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>accounting and invoicing</li>
                <li>tracking sales</li>
                <li>planning</li>
                <li>performance monitoring </li>
                <li>communications (including webmail and messaging)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">Traditional software vs. Software as a Service</p>
            <p>Traditional software</p>
            <ul>
                <li>users purchase the software upfront as a package and then install it onto their computer</li>
                <li>licences may be limited to the number of users and/or devices where the software can be deployed </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Software as a Service</p>
            <ul>
                <li>users subscribe to the software, usually on a monthly basis, rather than purchase it, meaning no upfront costs</li>
                <li>users can usually end their subscription when they no longer require it</li>
                <li>applications are updated and used online with files saved in the cloud rather than on individual computers</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">Benefits of SaaS</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>no hardware costs</strong>: Processing power is supplied by the cloud provider</li>
                <li><strong>no initial setup costs</strong>: Applications are ready to use once the user subscribes</li>
                <li><strong>pay for what you use</strong>: Particularly beneficial when something is only required for a short period</li>
                <li><strong>usage is scalable</strong>: Additional storage or services can be accessed on demand without needing to install new software and hardware</li>
                <li><strong>update are automatic</strong>: Updates are often free of change and deployed automatically by the software provider</li>
                <li><strong>cross device compatibility</strong>: Applications can be accessed via any internet enabled device, such as desktops, smart phones and tablets</li>
                <li><strong>accessible from any location</strong>: Users aren’t restricted to one location and can access applications from any internet enabled device</li>
                <li><strong>applications can be customised and white labelled</strong>: Applications can often be altered to suit the needs and branding of particular customers</li>

            <p>USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) is a Global System for Mobile(GSM) communication technology that is used to send text between a mobile phone and an application program in the network. Applications may include prepaid roaming or mobile chatting.<br>
                USSD is similar to Short Messaging Service (SMS), but,unlike SMS, USSD transactions occur during the session only. With SMS, message scan be sent to a mobile phone and stored for several days if the phone is not activated or within range.<br>
                The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) supports USSD. USSD is defined in the GSM standard documents GSM 02.90 and GSM 03.90.</p>
            <p>Why is this protocol, while not extraordinary, so powerful on the African continent? Answer: <strong>It works on every phone - every phone that suppports GSM which is most phones on the continent as you need a SIM card for your device.</strong></p>

            <h2>Voice Interface</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-design-voice-user-interfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>How to Design Voice User Interfaces</strong></a></p>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/voice-input-the-interface-problem-1700be45ec18" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Voice input: the interface problem</strong></a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.blog.google/inside-google/googlers/cathy-pearl-conversation-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cathy Pearl has learned the art and science of conversation</strong></a></p>
            <p>The issue with voice input is not the technology, it’s the interface.<br>
                In these systems, the intent of the spoken command may be high or low utility. The user’s utility doesn’t matter. High utility tasks are focused and specific, while low utility tasks are vague and hard to decipher. The system determines the utility of the user’s words according to its own needs. <br>
                These systems don’t deal in language as most linguists would define it. It’s a false model of language in which each statement should have a logical flow and intent because it serves their purpose in structuring a transaction of goods or information. 
            </p>
            <p>But real people don’t talk that way. This incompatibility between the transactional needs of the systems and the non-logical, unstructured form of human speech leads to errors and misunderstandings. Eliminating error and misunderstanding is the biggest challenge faced by the designers of voice input systems. Companies designing apps for Alexa and her sisters are encouraged to create a strong error strategy — to assume that misunderstanding, lack of understanding, and not hearing are the default outcomes.</p>
            <p>An important aspect of all human conversations is the assumption of shared understanding. People get really angry when they are asked to clarify statements that seem obvious to them.</p>
            <p>Because voice input technologies need all interactions to lead to a transaction, they attempt to clarify the details of those transactions. In the process, they must strike a balance between clarifying everything or disregarding those aspects of a statement they don’t understand.</p>
            <p>The interface that isn’t working is natural language. Natural human speech is a crappy interface for voice input technologies. The reason is simple: human speech was developed to be understood by another human being. Attempting to get a computer to understand speech at the level of sugar-addled toddler is fiendishly difficult.</p>
            <p>Voice input platforms try to solve this problem by focusing on certain key details called “slots” and clarifying them before moving on to the next key detail. The result is an interaction that has the most superficial form of human speech — alternating interlocutors — without any of the deep structures that makes human speech meaningful or useful. The only context is the assumption that the interaction should end with either a simple command (“Play the Talking Heads”) or a commercial transaction (“Buy Tide detergent.”)<br>
                    The solution to this problem is simple, but remains unacceptable to the companies that build these platforms: abandon natural language.</p>
            <p>Tone communicates a huge amount to human beings. If you have ever listened to people speaking a language you did not understand, you can gain a huge degree of comprehension through tone alone. Guitarists use these quirks of tone in language to make their guitars appear to “speak.” A few notes played in the correct order can handle the simple communications of voice output more efficiently than Alexa’s disturbing absence of vocal affect. Smart speakers attempt to create a rough approximation of the rise and fall of human speech.</p>
            <p>We speak the way dogs sniff at each others nethers. We fill the silence. We reassure. Spoken language is a reflection of our social nature.<br>
                If you want voice input to work really well, you need to remind users that they aren’t using spoken language. They are vocalizing with a purpose. Just like writing is an artificial form, this type of vocalizing needs to be artificial. </p>
            <p>Right now, all of these technologies operate on a similar model to Morse code. The sound is translated into written speech. Morse code is not a language like American Sign Language or French. It is a way of translating the alphabet into easily transmissible sounds or pulses. Similarly, Alexa takes sound waves and attempts to translate their patterns into written language which the system then uses to distill intent and fill slots.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">Conversation for voice interfaces</p>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/tips-on-designing-conversations-for-voice-interfaces-d4084178cfd2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tips on designing conversations for voice interfaces</strong></a></p>
            <p>More than often, people confuse conversational interfaces with anything that you use your voice to interact with. Asking your GoPro to click a picture is a one-off command, it is not technically a conversation. This is called a <strong>single-turn interaction</strong>. When designing VUIs, many only consider one-off tasks like answering a search query, placing a phone call, playing a song, etc. But there is much more to a conversation beyond command-and-control type interactions.<br>
                 <strong>A conversational interaction is an interaction beyond a single-turn</strong>. We simply call this <strong>multi-turn</strong>.</p>
